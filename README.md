# FFXIV Elemental raid macros

This repository is a collection of macros (and my notes) often encountered in the Elemental Data Center (DC).

Because Elemental is ultimately a Japanese DC, these macros are for Japanese PF strategies. Keep that in mind that when watching (English) videos/reading guides- the strategies used may have some differences from the ones here.

Of course, there will probably be small differences between the macros here and the ones you may encounter in PF- use the ones here as a base to work with.

## On macros

Remember, the ultimate goal of PF macros is to get eight people who have never played together a clear (quickly). As a result, PF favours safer, simpler strategies, even if it means disconnecting from the boss. If you want uptime, make a static.

**Tanks:**
- Who MTs (main-tanks) and who STs (sub-tanks) generally follows this order:
        **MT** : WAR > DRK > GNB > PLD : **ST**

- You will often see English players call the ST the OT instead (off-tank).
- A note on tank swaps: Sometimes, the "MT" position refers to the original maintank, and sometimes "whoever happens to be tanking the boss at the time". As a general rule, if where the boss faces is relevant, then "MT" will refer to whoever is currently tanking the boss.

**Healers:**
- **H1** is the "pure healer" (WHM, AST).
- **H2** is the "barrier healer" (SCH, SGE).

**DPS:**
The standard composition consists of one melee, one physical ranged, one caster, and one flex DPS (typically a second melee/caster).

- **D1** is the melee spot (SAM, DRG, MNK, RPR, NIN)
- **D2** is the flexible DPS slot, and is typically a second melee or caster. In double melee-compositions, a NIN is typically D2.
- **D3** is a physical ranged (BRD, MCH, DNC)
- **D4** is a caster (BLM, RDM, SMN)

## PF and progression

Generally, PF recruitment will generally follow the following progression:

- First time/初見 : Sometimes, you'll see 未予習 which means "without prep" or basically going blind, or 予習済 which is "have prepared" (have watched guides/videos)
- Practice○○/○○練習 : You will often see a mechanic in place of ○○, although 前半 is also common ("first half"). The focus is on learning the mechanic.
- Stabilize○○/○○安定: An extension of the above, except you are expected to have reached the mechanic before and the aim is to resolve the mechanic consistently.
- Aim to clear (A2C)/クリ目 : It is expected that you have made it to enrage at this point, and know all the mechanics. A couple words to look out for are:
    - 未 (not yet);　e.g: "未消化" = "not yet done weeklies"
    - 済 (already);　e.g: "クリア済" = "already cleared"
    - 手伝いさん (helpers)
- Weekly clear/消化 : You'll often see additional stipulations, like the party disbanding after three wipes, or after 30 minutes. These aren't practice parties. At least, they're not supposed to be. -_-
    - 3滅解散 - "disband after three wipes" is quite common with these parties.

## Loot rules

- フリロ : "Free-lot". Basically roll Need/Greed on whatever you want.
- 取り抜け : Take and drop. Everyone takes turns rolling on loot one at a time. Anyone who wins an item then drops from the instance (so everyone only gets 1 item at most).

Oftentimes, this is "take and drop from the left" (左から取り抜け), but it's also common to explicitly list out an order for 4th floor raids, like "Weapon > Weapon coffer > Body coffer > Others" (武器＞武器箱＞胴箱＞他)
