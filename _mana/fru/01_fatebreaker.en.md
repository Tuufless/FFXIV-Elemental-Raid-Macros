# Fatebreaker（フェイトブレイカ）

## Cyclonic Break（サイクロニックブレイク）

Fatebreaker opens with *Cyclonic Break*, which is a mechanic that reappears 
shortly in the middle of *Utopian Sky*.

The boss will return to the arena with *Burnished Glory*（光焔光背）, a
heavy-hitting raid-wide that also applies a DoT on the party.

Shortly after, the boss then prepares the second mechanic combo.

## Fall of Faith（シンソイルセヴァー）

This is resolved with a "West-to-East" conga line to help sort out 
priorities.

After this, the boss begins to cast a *Burnished Glory* as the hard enrage for 
the phase.

Note that in order to best align cooldowns (both 2-minute bursts, and defensive
cooldowns), you will want to defeat the Fatebreaker *as late as possible*.
