# Usurper of Frost（シヴァ・ミトロン）

The tank that opens this fight should be the tank that did not invuln the
second *Powder Mark Trail* towards the end of P1 (which is usually the MT).

The boss opens the fight with *Quadruple Slap* on the tank. Despite the name, 
this is actually a "two-hit" tankbuster, but the first hit applies a *Physical 
Vulnerability Up* debuff that *can* be Esuna'ed.

Both hits can be invulned.

The boss will auto-attack twice after the tankbuster, and its damage is
increased with the *Physical Vulnerability Up* debuff.

Either *Esuna* the *Physical Vulnerability Up*, mitigate through the two
auto-attacks, or have the ST *Provoke* the boss to take the auto-attacks.

The boss then teleports slightly south of center and casts *Mirror Image*
which summons an (untargetable) Oracle's Reflection before casting *Diamond
Dust* for heavy raid-wide damage.

## Diamond Dust（ダイヤモンド・ダスト）

*Diamond Dust* resolves itself in a very similar way to *Diamond Frost* in
Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage).

## Sunbound Holy

The Oracle's Reflection then casts *Sunbound Holy*, which targets each healer 
four times with a 4-man stack AoE that also leaves a puddle behind. Each party 
needs to drop these puddles and end up **either directly behind the boss**, or 
**at least 135 degrees away from the boss**.

Because the Usurper of Frost teleports to a random cardinal/intercardinal 
position, we have four possible cases.

Essentially (with the exception of the first puddle), the party *cannot* drop
the puddles directly behind the Usurper of Frost.

<table>

      <p><b>Case 1: The Usurper of Frost is at the same position as either party.</b></p>

      Morn</em> puddle behind the boss (as it will disappear), but not the
      second.</p>
      <p>Quickly run clockwise 180 degrees around the arena- you need to drop
      four puddles and still make it to the other side.</p>
      <p>When the floor turns to ice, slide so you're in front of the Usurper of 
      Frost.</p>

      anti-clockwise.</p>
      <p>The party further from the Oracle of Frost will go slowly clockwise.</p>

The Usurper of Frost reappears back in the center of the arena and casts 
*Hallowed Ray* on the party (which is a heavy-hitting line stack) before 
starting the next set of mechanics.

## Mirror, Mirror（鏡の国）

The Usurper of Frost will be targetable during this mechanic.

Two red mirrors and one blue mirror appear at the edge on any of the eight
cardinal/intercardinal positions.

- Blue mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, resolving at *the same
  time*.
- Red mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, but *resolves later*.
- The two red mirrors always spawn 90 degrees from one another.

After this, the boss will teleport to the middle and begin another signature 
mechanic.

## Light Rampant（光の暴走）

Two players at random will be selected to drop AoE puddles, while the other six
will get tethered together *(Chains of Everlasting Light)*.

- After 10 seconds, the *Chains of Everlasting Light* debuff will turn into 
  *Curse of Everlasting Light*. From this point on, the raid wipes if the 
  tethers get too short.
- Two connected players will also have a 16 second *The Weight of Light*
  debuff. When the timer expires, this explodes with a 4-man stack.

There will also be six stacks of *Lightsteeped* randomly distributed among the 
party.

*(Full-size image: [English]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru_mana/02/lr_44_east.jpg))*

A few seconds later, the boss will start to cast *Absolute Zero*. This will
serve as the hard enrage, *unless* the boss is brought under 20.0% HP.

If the DPS check is met, *Absolute Zero* will be a raid-wide and a knockback
instead, so stay near the middle.

## Endless Ice Age

This is the mini "transition" phase.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> You can choose to caster LB3 all the crystals instead to get
  past this phase and get some P3 practice in instead- if you do so, you will
  <em>not</em> be able to get past P4 (although you will have until then to
  stabilize this phase).</p>
  <p>If you caster LB3, remember to attack the Crystals of Light while waiting
  for the LB3 to resolve- the LB3 alone will <em>not</em> destroy the Crystals
  of Light.</p>
  <p>Once all the Crystals have been destroyed, the Ice Veil will lose its
  invulnerability and can be destroyed (without Gaia's help).</p>

Once the four Crystals of Light have been destroyed (with all four Crystals of
Darkness alive), Gaia will exclaim, *"My power surges!"* and the Ice Veil will
lose its invulnerability.

If all the Crystals of Darkness are still alive, Gaia will gain enough power
and deal 50.0% damage to the Ice Veil just before *Endless Ice Age*
resolves. As a result, the damage check is to get the Ice Veil below 50.0% HP.

If all goes well, an ice necklace will briefly appear on the ground next to the
Usurper of Frost, which will be quickly absorbed.

Stack south to prepare for the next phase- the Usurper of Frost will do one
raid-wide (called *Junction*) and reveal herself to be Mitron before possessing
Gaia and turning her into the Oracle of Darkness.

      <p>As such, the failure cases are either:</p>

        <li>Destroying at least one Crystal of Darkness <em>(Gaia will have
        insufficient power to execute the attack)</em>.</li>

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>For context, this is a problem specific to playing on a controller.</p>
      <p>Keyboards don't have this problem because pressing "W" moves your
      character perfectly forward. On a controller, pushing the analogue 
      stick forward will not be perfect, so that slight deviation may be 
      enough to get you killed.</p>
      <p>Something that might help would be to set up a macro like so:</p>
      <pre>/automove on
/automove off</pre>
      <p>This will make your character take one tiny step directly forward 
      where your camera is facing.</p>

  <b>[Light Rampant]</b> How do you prevent the tethers from getting tangled?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Unfortunately, having tangled tethers is uncommon (less than 2/21 
      chance), and there is no way to guarantee that you will <em>never</em> 
      encounter tangled tethers due to the way <em>Light Rampant</em> issues
      the debuffs.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, pick two random players to get puddles.</li>
        <li>Then, pick a random player to start the tether chain.</li>
        <li>Connect that player to the closest player without either a puddle
        or a tether.</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step six times from the last connected player.
          <ul>
            <li>If there are fewer than six non-puddle players available, pick
            a puddle player last.</li>
            <li>If there are fewer than six players available, wipe the raid.</li>
          </ul>
        </li> 
      </ol>
      <p>Because of this, it is possible to get tangled patterns if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two puddle players are next to each other.</li>
        <li>The tether starts two players away from a puddle.</li>
        <li>The tether first connects towards a puddle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the example on the right:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Both MT and ST are selected for puddles.</li>
        <li>H1 is randomly picked as the starting tether player.</li>
        <li>H1 tethers to the closest available player, which is H2 (moving 
        towards the puddles).</li>
        <li>H2 then tethers to the closest available player, which is D1 (not
        D4), and now you have a tangled tether.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If the tethers are tangled, then the tethers will criss-cross. Swap
      the two players around (H1 and H2 in this example) to untangle the
      tethers.</p>
