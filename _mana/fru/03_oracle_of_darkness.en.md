# Oracle of Darkness（闇の巫女）

The Oracle of Darkness starts south, and immediately opens with *Hell's
Judgment*, which sets everyone to 1HP.

She will then teleport to the middle of the arena and prepare her first
major mechanic with a heavy raid-wide.

Typically, if LB3 is available, this is where a melee would LB3 the Oracle of
Darkness. Who LBs is usually discussed at the start (and may change if there's
a DNC in the party), but a priority may look something like:

## Ultimate Relativity（時間圧縮・絶）- Poni Kone

When *Ultimate Relativity* resolves, there will be a lot of debuffs that go 
out. However, you only need to check a limited set of debuffs.

The party can be split up into three groups based off the duration of each 
player's *Dark Fire III* debuff.

- Three players (two DPS and one tank/healer) will get 10s Fire debuffs (the "short Fires").
- Two players (one tank/healer and one DPS) will get 20s Fire debuffs (the "mid Fires"). 
- Three players (two tanks/healers and one DPS) will get 30s Fire debuffs (the "long Fires").

Either the tank/healer short Fire, or the DPS long Fire will have their *Dark 
Fire III* debuff replaced with *Dark Blizzard III*.

The first step is to assign hourglasses to players. The basic rules are:

- **Short fires** go to **empty** spots.
- **Mid fires** go to the **purple** tethered spots.
- **Long fires** go to the **yellow** tethered spots.

This is a *tethers-relative* assigment.

Each player is expected to carry a set of macros that do two things:

- Mark themselves with the appropriate marker based on whether you're short,
  mid, or long Fire.
- Dump the sequence of mechanics (in order) in `/echo` chat.

Once you have your assigned hourglass, you can resolve everything by staying 
in the center, only moving out to resolve specific debuffs.

- When it's your turn to resolve *Dark Fire III*, do so outside.
- When it's your turn to record:
  - Short and Mid Fires do so *just* behind their hourglass.
  - Long Fires do so in the center, *just* towards their hourglass.
- When your hourglass starts spinning, go bait the laser beam.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>A good trick to use when baiting your hourglass's laser is to position 
      yourself such that the hourglass frame covers the black dot in the center 
      of the "Spell-in-Waiting" icon above your character (when your camera
      faces towards the outside).</p>

You can either refer to the macros above that dump the order of events in
`/echo` chat, or just read off what you're supposed to do next from the next
debuff that's expiring. Every 5 seconds, *something* happens (stack in mid if
you don't have a debuff that's about to resolve, and your hourglass isn't
spinnning).

After you gain control of your characters, stack up in the middle to share a 
*Shell Crusher* AoE. The hourglasses will disappear, and the boss casts a 
raid-wide *Shockwave Pulsar*. The boss will then target the first player in 
aggro with *Black Halo*, a two-player tankbuster cleave.

## Apocalypse（アポカリプス） - Permaswap, Coloured Apocalypse

The boss will be targetable for the duration of this mechanic.

Before the cast, the Oracle of Darkness first casts *Spell-in-Waiting Refrain* 
which puts three pairs of *Dark Water III* on six different players to be 
resolved during *Apocalypse*.

This effectively creates four pairs of players (including the two players who
did not get any *Water III*).

We need to sort out the party into two groups of four, such that each group has
one of each debuff (nothing, 10s, 29s, 38s).

This may necessitate one or two pairs swap around (depending on the number of 
duplicates).

This variant makes the party adjust just once at the start of the mechanic, and
keeps the groups that way until the end.

However, *in exchange*, all players (other than H2 and D4) will need to be 
comfortable with dodging the Apocalypse AoEs from different positions. There is 
also a chance of melee downtime (although this can be mitigated by giving it to
a tank).

The boss ends this sequence with another *Shockwave Pulsar* before casting 
*Memory's End* for the enrage. Like the previous phase, the Oracle of Darkness
must be brought down to under 20.0% HP to advance.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Debuffs]</b> What is the difference between <em>Dark Water III</em> and
  <em>Unholy Darkness</em>? Aren't they both stacks?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>Dark Water III</em> and <em>Unholy Darkness</em> are both stacks
      with one crucial difference:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Dark Water III</em> needs at least <b>four</b> people in the
        stack to avoid the <em>Mark of Mortality</em> debuff.</li>
        <li><em>Unholy Darkness</em> needs at least <b>five</b> people in the
        stack to avoid the <em>Mark of Mortality</em> debuff.</li>
      </ul>

<summary>
  <b>[Apocalypse]</b> Are there cases where more than one pair needs to swap?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Yes. It's rare (3/35 chance), but certainly possible.</p>
      <p>Consider the following example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nothing: MT + ST</li>
        <li>Short Water: H1 + H2</li>
        <li>Mid Water: D1 + D3</li>
        <li>Long Water: D2 + D4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The T/H and DPS groups each have two duplicate debuffs, so we will 
      have four players swapping groups (MT, H1, D1, D2).</p>
      <p>Most of the time, one pair will need to swap (24/35 chance). The 
      probability that <em>nobody</em> has to swap is 8/35.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Darkest Dance]</b> How do tank invulns here interact with the rest of the 
  fight?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Some important relations to keep in mind are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>WAR</b> and <b>DRK</b> can both invuln <em>Darkest Dance</em>,
        and have <em>Holmgang/Living Dead</em> back in time for the first 
        <em>Wings Dark and Light</em> in the final phase.</li>
        <li><b>GNB</b> and <b>PLD</b> can both invuln <em>Darkest Dance</em>. If 
        they do, their invuln will <em>not</em> be available for the first 
        <em>Wings Dark and Light</em> in the final phase (but it will be 
        available for the second).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, PLD is the only tank that cannot invuln <em>Somber Dance</em> 
      in P4 and have it available for either <em>Wings Dark and Light</em> in
      the final phase, so prioritize letting PLD bait <em>Darkest Dance</em> 
      with <em>Hallowed Ground</em> in this phase to extract the most out of
      your tank invulns.</p>
