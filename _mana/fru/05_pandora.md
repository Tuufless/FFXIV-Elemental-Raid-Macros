# Pandora

Mana PF also uses Nukemaru's video for this phase.

{% include youtube.html id="nzpOdfOyUNo" %}

After the cutscene, Pandora quickly opens with her first mechanic.

## Fulgent Blade（光塵の剣）

The boss will cast *Fulgent Blade*, which starts with raid-wide damage. The 
boss will also autoattack during this sequence (before casting to cast *Akh 
Morn*).

Pandora's autoattacks hit the **top two** players with hate (which should be 
both tanks).

Have the MT *Provoke* to take the boss back, and face the boss to any of the
eight cardinal/intercardinal markers to prepare for the final mechanic of the
loop.

## Polarizing Strikes（星霊の剣）

This is the simplest mechanic of the phase, consisting of four rounds of stack 
damage.

    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>19.</b> Make two lines SW and SE with the tanks in front.</p>

      shortly.</p>
      <p>The player in front of each line (which should be the tanks) will also
      get a <em>Light Resistance Down</em> or a <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> 
      debuff (depending on which line hit them).</p>

      Resistance Down</em> and <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> debuff, they
      cannot rejoin their previous line.</p>

After this, Pandora casts *Pandora's Box*, which is a Tank LB3 check.

From there, the mechanics repeat one more time from *Fulgent Blade*, and ends
with a third round of *Fulgent Blade* into *Akh Morn*.

After that, Pandora casts *Paradise Lost* as the hard enrage.

Sometime during *Paradise Lost* (when the castbar reaches the "r" in
"Pa**r**adise"), Ryne will exclaim *"You can weather this! I know you can!"*
and give you 1.5 bars worth of Limit Break, which should reach an LB3. When
she does so, *immediately* LB3 (or it will not resolve before the enrage).

Who LBs is usually discussed at the start, or during the cutscene before this 
phase (and may change if there's a DNC in the party), but a priority may look 
something like:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Limit Break priority</b></td>
    <td>MNK > DRG > NIN > SAM > VPR > RPR</td>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Fulgent Blade]</b> Why should the MT stay close to the inner corner of
  the diamond while dodging?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>This is done to orient the boss so that it is easy for the party to
      split for <em>Akh Morn</em>.</p>
      <p>The more the MT dodges to the side of the diamond where the exalines
      originated from (the area marked red), the more the boss is turned when

      <p>The more the MT dodges towards the side of the diamond where the

      <p><b>Note:</b> this is particularly pronounced when the MT dodges the 
      Exalines diagonally (see Step 7 above), because it encourages them to 
      dodge to that side of the diamond.</p>
