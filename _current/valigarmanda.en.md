# Worqor Lar Dor (Extreme)

[Game8.jp](https://game8.jp/ff14/622480) went along with Hamkatsu's guide, 
but with Nukemaru's markers:

## Japanese

## Markers

- The `1234` markers are the spots for the Fire pairs during the donut AoE.
- The `1` and `2` markers are safe for the party during *Mountain Fire*.
- The `A` and `B` markers are the safe spots for dodging the Ice Stars in 
  *Skyruin*:Ice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Hail of Feathers]</b> Why do we destroy the second feather instead of the
  first?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Destroying the first feather maximises the time the party has before 
      <em>Blighted Bolt</em> resolves. However, the party has plenty of time 
      to destroy the second feather instead.</p>
      <p>More importantly, you <b>cannot stay and melee the boss</b> after
      destroying the first feather, as it is too close to the sixth (and final)
      feather.</p>
      <p>This is <em>not</em> the case for the second feather- players can 
      switch over to the boss without needing to pay attention to when the 
      later feathers will fall.</p>
