# Eyes

There are **many** Eyes strats out there. The following illustrates the strat
used in the macro.

---

## T/H red, DPS blue

This phase references the Fang and Claw phase from Nidhogg EX.

Players get tethered with either blue or red tethers where:

- When a player with a **blue tether** takes damage, the blue eye
  **gets healed**.
- When a player with a **red tether** takes damage, the red eye
  **also takes damage**.

When two players with different coloured tethers touch one another, they will
swap tethers. Doing so also applies a 3-second *Bound and Determined* debuff,
which prevents an additional swap for the duration.

The party now has until the *Nidhogg's Influence* gauge reaches 100 to defeat 
both eyes, failing which Estinien transforms into Nidhogg for an enrage.

# Saving Haurchefant

Once the eyes are defeated, time rewinds to the end of Phase 1. The key
difference is that now players have access to a Tank LB3 that's needed to save
Haurchefant.

- The method for Pure of Heart is exactly the same as Phase 1.
- Tank LB3 must be used **after** Haurchefant appears on the arena, but
  **before** he gets hit by the Spear of the Fury.

The Tank LB3 will reduce the damage Haurchefant takes, and also allows him to
be healed.

After Pure of Heart resolves, the Spear of the Fury becomes targetable, and
casts Pierce. The Spear must be destroyed before Pierce resolves, or
Haurchefant dies.

If Haurchefant dies in this phase, the fight loops back to Thordan in Phase 2.

### Notes

- The first two Brightwind hits on the healers will be covered by the Tank LB3.
- In Phase 1, the pulsing AoE damage from the Spear ends early when Haurchefant
  is killed. This time around, Haurchefant stays alive so the pulsing AoE
  damage will continue until Pure of Heart resolves.
- Haurchefant will take heavy damage from Pure of Heart, and will need to be
  roughly 65% health to survive.
- Benediction **works** on Haurchefant.
