# Dragonking Thordan

There are a couple of details that we should first go over before going into
the main mechanics loop.

## Mitigations

This phase requires some mitigation planning. To get the most use out of all
the party's cooldowns, you'd do something like the following: <a href="#-strategy-related-questions">

Note that there is a need to time some mitigation at the second autoattack
before *Akh Morn's Edge*. This is done to gain additional uses:

- H2 30s will be back for *Gigaflare's Edge*.
- MT 90s, ST 90s, D3 will be back for *Akh Morn's Edge* #3.

## Basic Mechanics

Dragonking Thordan has two basic mechanics that are worth mentioning.

### Fire/Ice of Ascalon

All of Dragonking Thordan's major mechanics are combined with either Fire or
Ice of Ascalon, which resolves together at the beginning of the mechanic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="34%">
      <p>If Dragonking Thordan's swords glow <b>red</b>, he will use <em>Fire of
      Ascalon</em>, which is a point-blank AoE.</p>
      <p>Players must be <b>outside</b> his targeting circle.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/fire_of_ascalon_01.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/fire_of_ascalon_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="34%">
      <p>If Dragonking Thordan's swords glow <b>blue</b>, he will use <em>Ice
      of Ascalon</em>, which is a donut AoE.</p>
      <p>Players must be <b>inside</b> his targeting circle.</p>
    </td>
    <td width="33%"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/ice_of_ascalon_01.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/ice_of_ascalon_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Trinity

After each mechanic has completed, Dragonking Thordan will auto-attack twice.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p>Each auto-attack hits <em>three</em> players:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The player with highest aggro will get hit with dark damage, and
        gain a stack of Dark Resistance Down.</li>
        <li>The player with the second-highest aggro will get hit with light
        damage, and gain a stack of Light Resistance Down.</li>
        <li>The <b>closest</b> player will get hit, and gain a stack of Dark
        Resistance Down, Light Resistance Down, and Physical Vulnerability Up.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/trinity.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Over the course of the fight, the non-tank players will rotate in to take one
auto-attack each.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After Exaflare's Edge</b></td>
    <td>D1 → D2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After Akh Morn's Edge</b></td>
    <td>D3 → D4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After Gigaflare's Edge</b></td>
    <td>H1 → H2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Because of the stacking Light/Dark Resistance Down debuffs on the tanks, the
tanks will be constantly swapping aggro throughout the fight.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> It's easy for the tanks to lose track of who is supposed to be
  tanking the boss. To help keep track of things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add text to a Provoke macro so the chat log has a record of who last
    Provoked.</li>
    <li>The tank with <b>0 or 1 stack of Dark Resistance Down</b> should be
    holding aggro.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

With all that setup, we can now go over Dragonking Thordan's major mechanics.

---

## Mechanics Loop

Dragonking Thordan will execute the following loop three times:

1. [Exaflare's Edge](#exaflares-edge)
2. [Akh Morn's Edge](#akh-morns-edge)
3. [Gigaflare's Edge](#gigaflares-edge) *(this will be replaced with*
   *[Morn Afah's Edge](#morn-afahs-edge) on the third loop.)*

### Exaflare's Edge

Have the tank with aggro point Dragonking Thordan either North or South before
the start of this mechanic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Three Exaflare telegraphs will appear relative to Thordan's
      orientation.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> Focus on the bright dot at the center of the Exaflare at
      Thordan's back. This will be your first dodge point.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/exaflare_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>3.</b> When the Exaflares resolve, dodge to where the bright dot
      was.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/exaflare_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>4.</b> Dodge a second time to avoid the next set of Exaflare AoEs.</p>
      <p>If Thordan is facing either north or south, dodging backwards to this
      spot on the floor (see the diagram) will <b>always</b> be safe.</p>
      <p>As you get more experienced with the mechanic, you will notice
      Exaflare patterns where you can maintain melee uptime <em>(dodging to the
      left in this case)</em>, but this is not necessary.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/exaflare_04.jpg"></td>

<summary>
  <b>[Click to Expand] Uptime Exaflare's Edge</b>
</summary>
<p>Dodging south as explained above will be safe for <em>all</em> possible
Exaflare configurations.</p>
<p>This obviously puts the party out of melee range. However, it <em>is</em>
possible to dodge <em>all Exaflare's Edge</em> combinations with <em>full melee
uptime</em>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Your first dodge will always be to the center of an Exaflare.</li>
  <li>The orientation of the other two Exaflares determine your second dodge.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is <em>not</em> an exhaustive list, but Exaflares generally fall into
one of the following four categories:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>Case 1: Neither NW or NE Exaflares are diagonal.</b></p>
      <p>This is the "easy" case, and only needs one dodge into the South
      Exaflare.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move to the center of the South Exaflare.</li>
        <li>Stay where you are.</li>
      </ol>

    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/uptime_exaflare_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Case 2: Only the NW Exaflare is diagonal.</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move to the center of the South Exaflare.</li>
        <li>Dodge to the left.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/uptime_exaflare_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Case 3: Only the NE Exaflare is diagonal.</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move to the center of the South Exaflare.</li>
        <li>Dodge to the right.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/uptime_exaflare_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Case 4: Both the NW and NE Exaflares are diagonal.</b></p>
      <p>This is the "forced downtime" pattern <em>(if you use the South
      Exaflare)</em>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move to the center of the South Exaflare.</li>
        <li>Dodge south.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Note:</b> As shown in the second diagram, it <em>is still
      possible</em> to dodge this configuration with full melee uptime if you
      first dodge into the North-West or North-East Exaflare instead.</p>
      <p>However, you will still need to read the other two Exaflares to
      determine your second dodge.</p>
      <p>The South Exaflare may also pass through the center of your chosen
      Exaflare, so not all Exaflares are equal. In this example, <em>only</em>
      the NW Exaflare has the "dodge in, and stay" movement, while you will
      need to adjust slightly if you used the NE Exaflare.</p>
      <p>Personally, I feel the additional complexity is not worth the uptime
      in this scenario, but the option <em>is</em> there if you know what
      you're doing.</p>

</div>

Thordan will then auto-attack twice, which should be taken by the two tanks,
and D1, followed by D2.

The tanks should continue to face Thordan north or south, away from the party.

### Akh Morn's Edge

Thordan will spawn three towers relative to where he is facing:

- One red tower at his front-left
- One red tower front-right
- One blue tower at his rear

The blue tower deals increased damage, and is meant to be taken by the tanks.

All players must be **inside** Thordan's hitbox in order to be within healing
range of both healers- remember to step inside if Thordan's swords were
originally red.

*Akh Morn's Edge* will be resolved with a 3-3-2 split. <a href="#-strategy-related-questions">

</table>

Thordan will then auto-attack twice, which should be taken by the two tanks,
and D3, followed by D4.

Where Thordan faces after *Akh Morn's Edge* doesn't matter.

### Gigaflare's Edge

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><em>Gigaflare's Edge</em> is a series of three raid-wide AoEs, each
      with an epicenter in a triangle going clockwise or anti-clockwise around
      Dragonking Thordan.</p>
      <p>Although the damage <em>technically</em> falls off with distance, the
      falloff is steep enough that they are practically just AoEs. Standing
      inside the marked region <em>(illustrating a South Gigaflare)</em> will
      one-shot a player, while standing outside just deals heavy damage. 
      <a href="#-frequently-asked-questions">
        <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/huh.png">
      </a></p>
      <p>Mitigations for <em>Gigaflare's Edge</em> should be timed as the
      entire sequence lasts 8 seconds, while several debuffs (Reprisal, Feint,
      Addle) lasts only 10 seconds.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/gigaflare.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Thordan will then auto-attack twice, which should be taken by the two tanks,
and H1, followed by H2.

After *Gigaflare's Edge*, whoever's tanking the boss should face the boss
**directly North or South** to prepare for *Exaflare's Edge*.

The loop then repeats from *Exaflare's Edge*.

---

## Morn Afah's Edge

Dragonking Thordan will put three towers and will continually hit them in quick
order.

As each set of towers kills three players, the party can only take two rounds
of towers as there aren't enough players to take the third set.

A general kill order should resemble:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>First set of towers</b></td>
    <td>H1, H2, MT</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Second set of towers</b></td>
    <td>D3, D4, ST</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Third set of towers</b></td>
    <td>Ignore <em>(let the tower failed animation wipe the party instead of
    having D1 and D2 killed by the towers.)</em></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Morn Afah's Edge towers will match the Akh Morn's Edge tower groups.

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b> After the first hit, Morn Afah's Edge will continually hit the
towers <b>every 3 seconds</b>- if you're not taking the first set, standby near
your tower, and do not wait to enter when it's your turn!</div>

---

## Buff windows

Assuming the party used potions at the start of P6, the buff/pot window timings
are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>First buff window</b></td>
    <td>After Gigaflare's Edge #1
      <a href="#-frequently-asked-questions">
        <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/icons/huh.png">
      </a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Second buff window</b></td>
    <td>During Akh Morn's Edge #3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Potions can be used at either burst window.

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>P7 lasts about 3:45 in total, so there's no way to fit in a

      <p>In addition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some players may have opted to use their burst at the end of P6,

        <li>Both dragons can also be downed immediately after <em>Touchdown</em> 
        if the party's DPS is high.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In either scenario, the 2-minute burst abilities may not necessarily be
      available at P7's opener, so setting the first burst after <em>Gigaflare's

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>1-1-6 at <em>Akh Morn's Edge</em> is a strat for two of the <em>Akh
      Morn's Edge</em>s that is easier to heal compared to 3-3-2 by having:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One tank invuln the tank tower.</li>
        <li>The other tank take one DPS tower solo with mitigation.</li>
        <li>All six non-tanks take the remaining DPS tower.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By doing so, the players in the DPS tower take roughly half the damage
      they would take compared to 3-3-2, while the solo tank in the DPS tower
      takes about the same amount of damage as they would take from sharing the
      tank tower.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/07/akh_morn_116.jpg">
      </p>
      <p>This looks like all-upside, however <b>it does not come for free</b>.</p>
      <p>The biggest obstacle to 1-1-6 is having to mitigate <em>Wyrmsbreath</em>
      2 and <em>Cauterize</em> with the same 30% at the end of P6.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The tank with a single-target tankbuster needs to time their 30% 
        mitigation at the last second before <em>Wyrmsbreath</em> 2.</li>
        <li>The healers need to top up the tanks (and potentially give targeted
        mitigation)- remember, the tanks are on the other side of the arena 
        during <em>Wyrmsbreath</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While this is doable, it's much tighter in execution than simply 
      invulning Cauterize, and makes P6 even less forgiving.</p>
      <p>Prog groups <em>especially</em> should aim to get more practice at P7, 
      and it's difficult to justify potentially spending more time in P6 for 
      <em>both</em> tanks to consistently (and independently!) get the timing 
      down.</p>
      <p>Even if Cauterize is properly mitigated, executing 1-1-6 still has some
      intangible tradeoffs. While it <em>is</em> easier to mitigate and heal 
      through, you open up different lines of error:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Either H2, D2, or D4 forgets and goes to the wrong tower at the 
        wrong <em>Akh Morn's Edge</em>.</li>
        <li>The wrong tank goes to the wrong tower at the wrong <em>Akh Morn's 
        Edge</em>.</li>
        <li>"Less healing" <em>does not</em> mean "no healing", especially 
        given 1-1-6's reputation of "letting healers parse". It's also easy
        for healers to forget that the tank in the DPS tower still takes a good
        amount of damage and needs healing as if they were doing 3-3-2.</li>
