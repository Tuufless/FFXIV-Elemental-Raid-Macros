# The Holy See

Dragonsong's Reprise is the first Ultimate to feature a "door boss" phase.

Once cleared, the party will not need to repeat this phase, although this
phase introduces various mechanics that will be encountered during the main
portion of the encounter.

---

## Opener

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> The two tanks will take the two bosses and
    stack them in the middle.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>MT:</b> Take Ser Grinnaux (the east boss)</li>
      <li><b>ST:</b> Take Ser Adelphel (the west boss)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Try to keep Ser Adelphel a little north of Ser Grinnaux to give more
    space for the upcoming combination.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ser Adelphel will tether a random player- this tether should be taken
      by the MT and invulned.</li>
      <li>Ser Grinnaux will use <em>Empty Dimension</em>, which is a donut
      AoE.</li>
      <li>Ser Charibert will target the furthest player from North with
      <em>Heavensflame</em>, which is a shared stack.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/adelphel_grinnaux_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The party here should focus on Ser Adelphel, as Adelphel will disappear
shortly. Ser Grinnaux will teleport to the center of the arena.

## Hyperdimensional Slash

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Four random players will get marked.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The marked players spread along the <b>south</b> side.
      <ul>
        <li>Each marked player will be hit by a <em>Hyperdimensional Slash</em>
        line AoE that leaves a void puddle where it hits the wall.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The remaining four unmarked players stack <b>north</b> to share a
      <em>Hyperdimensional Slash</em> cleave.</li>
    </ul></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/hyperdimensional_slash_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> All players now swap roles- the previously unmarked
    players will now get marked, and vice-versa.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Newly marked players spread along the <b>north</b> side for
      <em>Hyperdimensional Slash</em> line AoEs.</li>
      <li>The now unmarked players stack <b>south</b> to share a
      <em>Hyperdimensional Slash</em> cleave.</li>
    </ul></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/hyperdimensional_slash_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Ser Adelphel will reappear at a <b>random</b> cardinal
    edge and cast another <em>Holiest of Holy</em>.</p><p>Ser Grinnaux will
    also cast <em>Faith Unmoving</em>, a knockback that can be nullified with
    Arm's Length or Surecast. Be sure not to get knocked back into any of the
    void puddles along the wall.</p>
    <p>Ser Adelphel then dashes left or right to one of the <b>adjacent
    cardinal</b> walls.</p>
    <p>The party moves towards <b>whichever side Adelphel dashes to first.</b></p>
    <p><em>(In this example, Ser Adelphel dashes to the left.)</em></p></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/hyperdimensional_slash_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> A whole series of AoEs then resolve along Ser Adelphel's
    path.</p>
    <p>The tips of these spokes on the floor will <em>always</em> be safe from
    the AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/hyperdimensional_slash_04.jpg">
    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/hyperdimensional_slash_safe_spot.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>5.</b> The ST moves ahead of the party as Ser Adelphel will land
    on that player, knocking back and killing anyone else that gets hit.</p>
    <p>The ST can invuln this hit.</p><p>Ser Adelphel will then begin to cast
    <em>Holiest Hallowing</em>. This must be interrupted (by the ST), or it
    will recover 50% HP to both Ser Adelphel and Ser Grinnaux.</p></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/hyperdimensional_slash_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Playstation

The MT recenters Ser Grinnaux to prepare for the Playstation mechanic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Players will get paired together, indicated by
    Playstation symbols.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two DPS will be paired with a 〇</li>
      <li>A tank and a healer will be paired with an ×</li>
      <li>A healer and a DPS will be paired with a ▽</li>
      <li>A tank and a DPS will be paired with an □</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two 〇 DPS have a priority to determine who goes where:</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><b>West:</b> D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 <b>:East</b></p></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/playstation_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Ser Grinnaux then casts <em>Faith Unmoving</em> again,
    knocking all players back from Ser Grinnaux.</p>
    <p>This will break the chains that connect each Playstation pair, and each
    player will have a <em>Heavensflame</em> AoE centered on them.</p>
    <p>Note that we <b>do not</b> want to use anti-knockback abilities here, as
    we need the knockback in order to break the chains.</p></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/01/playstation_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

From here, the mechanics are straightforward:

- Ser Adelphel will then cast a second *Holiest Hallowing*, which should be
  interrupted by D3 this time.
- Ser Adelphel will cast another *Holiest of Holy* (raid-wide damage) while Ser
  Grinnaux will use either *Empty Dimension* (donut AoE) or *Full Dimension*
  (point-blank AoE).
- Ser Adelphel will then cast a third *Holiest Hallowing*, requiring another
  Silence, followed by another *Holest of Holy* (raid-wide damage).
- At this point, if both bosses are alive, they begin their enrage. If either
  boss dies, the other starts casting their enrage.

## Pure of Heart

Ser Charibert now appears west and pulls the party into a ring.

We resolve Ser Charibert's attacks in the order HMRT (Healer → Melee → Ranged
→ Tanks).

- Ranged and melee alternate sides when dropping the Light Puddles.
- Tanks are last so healers are not rushing to top up the party before Pure of
  Heart resolves.

This method allows for [full melee uptime with minimal movement](https://clips.twitch.tv/SuaveOddArmadilloSeemsGood-VfDpqFIoUkVKUF7Q).

The arena will change, and Thordan will appear. Make sure someone in the party
attacks Thordan, or you will restart from this phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Markers]</b> Why don't we use the uptime markers?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>These markers are even closer to the center, and provide full melee
      uptime during the <em>Hyperdimensional Slashes</em>.</p>
      <p>That being said, it is a tradeoff- a closer distance means players
      have to be more precise with their positioning, all while adjusting to
      one another.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The likelihood of two players clipping one another increases as
        players are closer together.</li>
        <li>The void puddle placements become more sensitive to player
        positioning, increasing the chance of dropping a void in a spot that
        will explode with the white orbs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given P1's DPS check (or lack thereof), this tradeoff between distance
      and accuracy isn't really worth it.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Playstation]</b> Why aren't the chains breaking?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The chains break when they are stretched beyond an additional distance
      from their <em>original</em> length. That is to say, if the two chained
      players start far apart, then the chain needs to be stretched longer for
      it to break (so starting further out, then coming in after the chains
      spawn for the knockback doesn't work).</p>
      <p>The knockback distance alone also isn't enough to break the chain- all
      players should <b>also move a bit further out towards the edges after the
      knockback</b> to ensure the chains break.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
