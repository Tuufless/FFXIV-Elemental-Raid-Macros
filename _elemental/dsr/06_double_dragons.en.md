# Double Dragons

As far as progression goes, reaching this phase for the first time marks
roughly the half-way point. The mechanics in this phase are not particularly 
difficult, but this phase is unforgiving.

The structure of this phase can be broken down as follows:

- First half
  - [Wyrmsbreath #1](#wyrmsbreath-1)
  - [Akh Afah #1](#akh-afah-1)
  - [Hallowed Wings #1](#hallowed-wings-1)
- [Wroth Flames](#wroth-flames)
- Second half
  - [Akh Afah #2](#akh-afah-2)
  - [Hallowed Wings #2](#hallowed-wings-2)
  - [Wyrmsbreath #2](#wyrmsbreath-2-5-1)
- [Cauterize](#cauterize)
- [Alternative End](#alternative-end)

### Enrage conditions

Each dragon also has their own enrage condition. Causing either dragon to break 
their vow will result in their attacks one-shotting anyone hit (including 
tanks), and lower their damage taken.

**Solemn Vow:** Hraesvelgr will enrage if he kills *any* player.
**Mortal Vow:** Nidhogg will enrage if *Mortal Vow* is not passed.

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>After Wyrmsbreath #1, Nidhogg will give a random DPS a <em>Mortal
      Vow</em> debuff. This debuff:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applies a light DoT on the player.</li>
        <li>Significantly <em>reduces</em> that player's healing potency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the debuff expires, it explodes in a small AoE, and the player
      that had <em>Mortal Vow</em> will now get a <em>Mortal Atonement</em>
      debuff that prevents them from getting <em>Mortal Vow</em> again.</p>
      <p><em>Mortal Vow</em> transfers onto a random player that was hit by the
      AoE that does not have <em>Mortal Atonement</em>. (If additional players
      are hit, they get a <em>Suppuration</em> debuff that halves their max HP.</p>
      <p>Thus, when passing <em>Mortal Vow</em>, we need <b>exactly two</b>
      players to stack- the player that has the debuff, and the player that is
      about to receive it.</p>

</div>

There are *four Mortal Vow* passes in this phase.

1. After Hallowed Wings #1
2. After Wroth Flames (this pass is *quick*)
3. After Hallowed Wings #2
4. After Cauterize → Touchdown

We pass "DTTMR", or in other words:

**DPS → MT → ST → D1/D2 → D3**

All passes happen in the center of the arena, except for the final pass after
Touchdown (which is just done at the edge).

---

## First half

This first part cycles through the three main mechanics of the fight.

As there are HP checks in this phase, we assign four players to each dragon as
a base:

- **MT, H1, D1, D3** → Prioritize Nidhogg
- **ST, H2, D2, D4** → Prioritize Hraesvelgr

### Wyrmsbreath #1

Each dragon will tether to three non-tank players that need to be sufficiently
stretched to lower their damage. They will also apply Fire or Ice aspected
debuffs that cancel each other, so each non-tank player needs to get hit
by a tether from *each* dragon.

The tanks also have their own mechanic- either one, or both dragon's mouths
will glow.

- If one dragon's mouth glows, the dragon whose mouth *doesn't* glow targets
  the person with hate for a giant AoE tankbuster.
- If both dragon's mouths glow, they will each target the person with hate for
  a Light or Dark-aspected AoE tankbuster. Like the tethers, these will cancel
  each other out.

### Hallowed Wings #1

Three things resolve simultaneously:

1. Nidhogg will disappear and appear along either the North or South edge. Nidhogg
   will then *Cauterize* down either the west or east, cutting off half the arena.
2. Either Hraesvelgr's left or right wing will glow, cleaving either the north or
   south half of the arena, leaving just one safe quadrant to work with.
3. Hraesvelgr will raise or lower his head and will hit the two furthest (head
   up) or two closest (head down) players with a large AoE tankbuster.

The party should continue to **attack Hraesvelgr** during this whole sequence,
even after Nidhogg returns.

After the *Mortal Vow* pass, Nidhogg will cast *Wroth Flames*, and Hraesvelgr
will leave the arena.

---

## Wroth Flames

Wroth Flames is the half-way point of this phase, separating the first and
second iteration of each of the looped mechanics.

- Hraesvelgr will become untargetable, and respawn on one of three positions  
  along either the North or South edge to *Cauterize* half the arena.
  *(this gives a 2/3 chance that the party will have melee uptime on Nidhogg*
  *during this mechanic.)*
- Nidhogg will cast *Akh Morn*, which is a party stack that hits four times.
  Each hit also leaves behind a puddle that will inflict a bleed on any player
  that stays inside for too long, killing that player.
- Three sets of *Sable Price* eyes will also spawn in sequence. Each set
  will explode in order, dealing damage along their row and column. The center
  set will always spawn first, followed by two more sets on opposite corners.
- Finally, the party will be affected by a variety of spread and stack debuffs 
  that will resolve at the end together with either *Hot Wing* or *Hot Tail* 
  from Nidhogg.

To help assign player positions for the final spread and stack, it is common
practice to mark the players. However, there are two different marking schemes.

<table>

    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>Option 1: Using third party-tools (Automarkers)</b></p>
      <p>By far the more popular approach is to just use third-party tools
      <em>(i.e: use at your own risk)</em> to automatically mark all players.</p>
      <p>With this configuration, the player with the <b>same-type</b> of
      markers will pair together (with the red "ignore" markers against the
      east wall).</p>

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>Option 2: Manually mark stacks</b></p>
      <p>If you are not using automarkers, then there are two methods to mark
      players.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>You can delegate marking to two players:</p>
          <ul>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Alternatively, each player can prepare to mark themselves:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assign one symbol for "white debuffs", one symbol for "no
            debuff", and have the four affected players mark themselves.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

Finally, when dropping *Akh Morns*, the most efficient movement (geometrically)
is to move **perpendicular from the wall in a straight line**, and then curve
in after the third Akh Morn.

Note that this *Mortal Vow* pass is *fast*, which is why we want to try to keep
the tanks near the middle of the arena if possible.

## Second half

The second half is a rehash of the first, with slightly different twists on the
same mechanics from earlier.

### Akh Afah #2

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> This works exactly the same as the first- both dragon's HP
      must be brought to within 3% of one another for their stack to survive.</p>
      <p>However, the catch is that depending on whether the party had
      uptime/downtime earlier on Hraesvelgr or Nidhogg during the previous
      mechanics, one of the two dragons' HP may be skewed to one side.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/06/akh_afah.jpg"></td>
  </tr>

### Hallowed Wings #2

    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>2.</b> This time, Hallowed Wings will happen in combination with
      Hot Wing <em>or</em> Hot Tail from Nidhogg.</p>

</details>

### Wyrmsbreath 2 (5-1)

This iteration of Wyrmsbreath is different because we **do not** want to stack
opposite tethers.

One player goes south (D3) to give additional space for the other five
non-tanks to spread out along the North edge. Note that all melees can still
maintain uptime on a dragon during the mechanic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> SW if Nidhogg's mouth isn't glowing (just inside the
        target circle by the edge).</li>
        <li><b>ST:</b> SE if Hraesvelgr's mouth isn't glowing (just inside the
        target circle by the edge).</li>
        <li><b>D3:</b> Go south, and <b>move towards a dragon whose mouth is
        glowing</b>.</li>
        <li><b>All other players:</b> Spread out along the <b>north</b> edge.
          <ul>
            <li>The north position should go to a <b>healer or caster</b> that
            is in the group with 3 tethers.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>In the first example, Hraesvelgr's mouth is glowing, while
      Nidhogg's is not, so the MT has a single-target tankbuster.</em></p>
      <p><em>In the second example, both mouths are glowing, so the tanks stack
      together for a shared tankbuster.</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/06/wyrmsbreath_02_a.jpg">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/06/wyrmsbreath_02_b.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The left-most and right-most players at the North can use the inner markers as
a guide. As long as their tethers **do not cross the center of the markers**,
they will be safe from the cone AoEs.

## Cauterize

The reason why we did not stack opposite tethers in Wyrmsbreath #2 was because
we needed the fire/ice debuffs in order to survive this mechanic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr will spawn along the north edge in a
      <b>random</b> configuration, and dive down each half.</p>
      <p>The first player hit by each dive takes additional damage, and are
      taken by the tanks with their invulns.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> West half, closest to the North edge.</li>
        <li><b>ST:</b> East half, closest to the North edge.</li>
        <li><b>Players with the Fire debuff:</b> Stand in the half in front of 
        Hraesvelgr. <em>Do not move.</em></li>
        <li><b>Players with the Ice debuff:</b> Stand in the half in front of 
        Nidhogg.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Do not move</b> as Nidhogg's debuff will turn into Pyretic. The
      resulting damage will result in Hraesvelgr's Cauterize killing you and
      cause Hraesvelgr to enrage.</p>
      <div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
        <b>Note:</b> If you have a DRK and are using <em>Living Dead</em> here, 
        neither dragon will be targetable for the DRK to recover HP for <em>Walking Dead</em>.
      </div>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/06/cauterize_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2. Mortal Vow pass #4</b></p>
      <p>After Cauterize, everybody gathers north to avoid Nidhogg's and
      Hraesvelgr's Touchdown damage.</p>
      <p>After Touchdown, all players move away from the stack point
      <em>except</em> the DPS with Mortal Vow and D3.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/dsr/06/mortal_vow_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After both dragons *Touchdown*, they will each start casting their enrage,
*Revenge of the Horde*.

## Alternative End

After the two dragons are defeated, the two dragon eyes will be left behind.
Just like before, they will do raid-wide damage with a bleed (*Resentment*).

This time around, if Thordan was spared in the previous phase, he will jump
down and do another raid-wide with a bleed on the party (*Shockwave*) before
taking the eyes for his own, starting his transformation to Dragonking Thordan.

When the bleed from *Shockwave* disappears, **heavily shield and mitigate** in
order to survive *Alternative End*, the final raid-wide damage that marks the
transition to the final phase *(Dragonking Thordan will not be targetable*
*during this)*.

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Note:</b> Each Bleed tick deals about ~14k damage. Make sure you
  <em>do not</em> apply shields until <em>after</em> the Bleed has worn off
  completely!</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> Thordan will announce <em>"Hahahaha! By the power of mine
  enemy's eyes..."</em> just before the second round of bleeds are applied.</p>
  <p>A DNC should start <em>Improvisation</em> when the dialogue box
  <em>disappears</em> to get the maximum value out of <em>Improvisation</em>'s
  shields.</p>

  <b>[Hallowed Wings 1]</b> Why should the party continue to attack Hraesvelgr after the first Hallowed Wings, even after Nidhogg returns?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is done to prepare for the second <em>Akh Afah</em> HP check that
      happens after <em>Wroth Flames</em>.</p>
      <p>Part of what makes the second <em>Akh Afah</em> dynamic is that 
      depending on whether the party (randomly) got uptime on Nidhogg or 
      Hraesvelgr, the HP may be skewed in one direction.</p>
      <p>That being said, it is <em>more likely</em> that Hraesvelgr will have
      more HP than Nidhogg after <em>Wroth Flames</em> because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The party has a 1-in-2 chance of downtime on Hraesvelgr during
        <em>Hallowed Wings</em> 1, but the chance of downtime on Nidhogg during
        <em>Wroth Flames</em> is lower at 1-in-3.</li>
        <li><em>Wroth Flames</em> coincides with the party's 1-minute abilities,
        so in the more likely event the party has uptime on Nidhogg, Nidhogg 
        would take more damage.</li>

  <b>[Wroth Flames]</b> Why are there two marking schemes?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The short answer is "that's just the automarker configuration that got
      passed around early."</p>
      <p>One that argue that if you mark all eight players, the visual clutter
      makes it hard(er) for each player to discern their number over their
      colour, hence the "same marker-type" stack configuration.</p>
    <p>I am personally not a fan because it is harder to replicate manually
    (effectively <em>mandating</em> automarkers).</p>
    <p>The problem with manually marking each pair using the same marker type
    is that this task cannot be split between two players, because there's now
    a possibility that the two players pick the same person twice.</p>
    <p>For example, in the configuration on the right, one person can pick the
    WAR + SMN as a pair, then the other pick RDM + SMN, doubling up on the SMN
    and leaving the SAM unmarked (it also doesn't help that <em>Mortal
    Atonement</em> looks like a purple spread debuff).</p>

      <p>The problem is that <em>Wyrmsbreath</em> 2 happens right before. There

      unforgiving enough).</p>
      <p>Prog groups <em>especially</em> should aim to get more P7 practice,
      and it is difficult to justify potentially spending more time in P6 for
      <em>both</em> tanks to consistently (and independently!) get the timing
      down.</p>
      <p>At this stage, most players in PF aren't used to resolving <em>Akh 
      Morn's Edge</em> in a 1-1-6 fashion, so trying to push 1-1-6 now may lead 
      to wipes in P7 due to players being unfamiliar with the strat.</p>

  <b>[Wyrmsbreath #1]</b> I took extra damage even though I wasn't tethered-
  why is that?

      <p><b>Both</b> dragon's damage are based on proximity, even if you are
      not actually tethered to them.</p>
      <p>You can think of the tethers as just directing where the breaths will 
      go; the colour change is a proximity indicator of that particular 
      player-dragon pair, but you still have to worry about proximity to the 
      other dragon.</p>
      <p>Here is a graph plotting damage vs distance (in centiyalms).</p>
