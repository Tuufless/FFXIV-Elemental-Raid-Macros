# Alternate Thordan

Thordan appears in the center of the arena, facing South. Thordan starts the
phase by casting *Incarnation*, which simply revives the dragons lying around
the arena, and casting *The Dragon's Eye*, which is simply a damage up buff.

Because Thordan will not move or rotate while casting these abilities, have the
MT start South, and the party North.

Thordan will auto-attack the MT twice (remember, these are cone AoEs!), before
jumping to the center of the arena and casting the first Trio combo of the
phase, *Wrath of the Heavens*.

Thordan will auto-attack the MT once, before doing a *Heavenly Heel* → 3x
*Ascalon's Might* combo.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b> A WAR can Holmgang this combo and have Holmgang back up in time for
Cauterize at the end of P6.</div>

After this, Thordan will begin the second major mechanic, *Death of the 
Heavens*.

## Death of the Heavens

My preferred strat is an upside-down version of the "Komazou" strat, which
splits the Dooms 2-2.

One important detail to note here is that the Playstation symbols are not
completely random- the circles are baited by the two Doomed players that are
the furthest apart from each other.

After Death of the Heavens, eight Meteor Circles will spawn that must be
quickly destroyed.

A caster LB2 will destroy three Meteor Circles; if there are no casters alive,
a ranged LB2 will also suffice.

- After all Meteors have been destroyed, Thordan will reappear in the middle
  and start casting *Ancient Quaga*.
- This is then followed by a *Heavenly Heel* → 3x *Ascalon's Mercy* combo.
- Thordan then auto-attacks one more time before casting *Aetheric Burst* as
  the enrage.

Once Thordan's HP drops **below 3.0%**, he will stumble, yield, and beg for
mercy. **Do not kill Thordan.**

Thordan will then become untargetable and jump away, moving the party onto the 
next phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Meteors]</b> Why caster LB2 instead of ranged LB2?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>A caster LB2 can target a Meteor and hit the two adjacent Meteors. A
      ranged LB2 will need to be properly aimed to hit three Meteors.</p>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Thordan]</b> What happens if you kill Thordan in this phase?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>At the end of the next phase with Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr, Nidhogg's
      eyes threaten to take over Estinien again.</p>
      <p>If Thordan was spared at the end of this phase, this is where Thordan
      jumps in to take the eyes and become Dragonking Thordan.</p>
      <p>However, if you kill Thordan in this alternate timeline, Thordan isn't
      around to take the eyes and the party returns to a repeat of the Eyes
      phase. This time around, Haurchefant isn't dead and the party is now
      missing Huarchefant's buff needed to damage the blue eye, leading to a
      wipe when the gauge fills.</p>

  <b>[Death of the Heavens]</b> Is there a particular reason why Dooms go North

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>

      <p>This is just for simplification- having the Dooms "North" (towards Ser
      Guerrique) couples the Dooms to North/South positions.</p>
      <p>That, in turn means that players can dodge based on whether they have
      Doom or not (Dooms dodge immediately, non-Dooms next), instead of adding
      a second layer of whether they're North or South.</p>
