# King Thordan

This is the "real" start of the fight, and the encounter will restart from this
point in the event of a wipe.

Thordan opens with two auto-attacks. Each auto-attack is a small cleave, so
Thordan should be pointed away from the party.

- Thordan will cast *Ascalon's Mercy Concealed*- this will fire a lethal cone
  AoE at each player. All players (except the MT) stack behind Thordan to bait
  these, and dodge to the side when the cast finishes.
- Thordan will then target the MT with three *Ascalon's Might* (large cleaves)
  before starting the first major mechanic.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b> A WAR can Holmgang this first set of <em>Ascalon's Might</em> and
have Holmgang back up in time.</div>

<table>

      <p><b>1.</b> Three knights will appear at three random (inter)cardinal
      positions outside of the arena. Each knight will also preparing a
      <em>Spiral Thrust</em> line dash across the arena. These line
      AoEs will never overlap one another, leaving just two safe sectors at
      opposite cardinal/intercardinal positions.</p>
      <p>The party needs to spread out inside these two safe sectors, as

### Part 2

The two knights that spawned towards the middle of the arena earlier orient the
map for the next part of *Strength of the Ward*. We consider the two knights
as "southwest" and "southeast".

This is because Thordan will teleport to "north", relative to these two
knights.

- Thordan will reappear in the middle of the arena and begin to cast *Ancient Quaga*.
- After the *Ancient Quaga*, Thordan will do another *Heavenly Heel* (tank
  swap), followed by 3x *Ascalon's Might*.

Thordan will then cast *Sanctity of the Ward*.

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Part 1: Sacred Severs

This mechanic consists of the following parts:

- Two knights (PLDs) will spawn a little east and west of the center, facing 
  either *clockwise* or *anti-clockwise*.
- Ser Zephirin (DRK) will spawn towards the outside, at an *intercardinal* 
  position.
- Thordan and a Dragon Eye will appear at two random cardinal/intercardinal
  locations, either 90, 135, or 180 degrees apart.
- Two random players will be assigned "1" and "2", indicated by the number of
  swords above their head.

Ser Zephirin will jump four times, alternating between the two players marked
"1" and "2". When he lands, he deals damage in an AoE that is shared amongst
the players hit. This damage *decreases* as the distance Ser Zephirin jumps increases.

We resolve Sacred Severs with a **DRK-relative, role-adjust** strat.

- MT, H1, D1, D3 takes Group 1 as its base position, **opposite** the DRK.
- ST, H2, D2, D4 takes Group 2 as its base position, on the **same side** as
  the DRK.

If a player in a group receives the wrong numbered sword for their group (e.g:
D3 receives the "2" sword), then the **corresponding role** in the other group
(D4) swaps groups with that person.

In other words:

1. If **you have a sword** above your head, **move to that group.**
2. Otherwise, if your **role-partner has your group's sword, swap groups.**

After Sanctity of the Ward, Thordan reappears North and begins casting
*Ultimate End* (which does not have a visible castbar). This is very-heavy
raid-wide damage that needs to be mitigated.

Thordan will flail around, doing two sets of *Broad Swings*. Each
*Broad Swing* requires the party to dodge from behind Thordan to either his
front-left or front-right, depending on which he cleaves first.

After both sets are complete, Thordan will cast *Aetheric Burst*, which
serves as the hard enrage for this phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Strength of the Ward]</b> Why are the healers in front?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Putting the healers in front lets them get to the middle quickly
  and start casting a GCD heal (hitting both light parties) <em>before</em>
  having to dodge the Ascalon's Mercy Concealed and <em>without</em> using
  Swiftcast.</p>
  <p>This affects AST and SCH (as opposed to WHM and SGE), as those healers do
  not have native access to GCD heals during movement.</p></td></tr>

  <b>[Strength of the Ward]</b> Why do we criss-cross the tank tethers?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Just like in P1, <em>Holy Shield Bash</em> deals damage based on how
      long the tether is, with lesser damage being dealt as the tether gets
      longer.</p>
      <p>Criss-crossing the tethers minimises the damage dealt.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Sanctity of the Ward]</b> Why is there a need for a role swap? Aren't
  there simpler strategies?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td>
    <p>We do a role swap because we want each group to have:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>One healer</li>
      <li>Four players</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This minimises the damage each group takes, while still being able to
    heal in between the two Sacred Severs each group takes.</p><p>You
    <em>can</em> use other strats under <em>certain</em> conditions (e.g: an
    AST's Macrocosmos lets you do pretty much any strat you want), but this
    unfortunately doesn't generalise to PF.</p></td>

<summary>
  <b>[Sanctity of the Ward]</b> Why don't we fix the DPS to go in or out
  instead of having to worry about Meteor roles?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The idea that players not have to worry about which role has Meteors 
      is a misnomer, because <em>all</em> players have to identify who the 
      Meteor players (and thus, role) are because even if they do not have 
      Meteor, they may have to potentially swap positions with someone who 
      does.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, fixing Meteors outside means that players that adjust,
      (i.e: whose group has Meteors), <em>always</em> go outside.</p>
      <p>This is important because the players that are adjusting have
      <em>less</em> time to identify their towers because they end up in a 
      different sector from the one they started in.</p>
      <p>For example, if we fixed DPS inside, a DPS from either N/S position
      that adjusts to either E/W position has to identify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which sector they are adjusting to (east or west)</li>
        <li>Whether <em>that</em> sector has two towers outside (because they 
        will need to go in if there is only one tower outside).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By fixing the Meteor group outside, the players that adjust have the 
      simpler task (always go out), while the players that stay behind (and 
      have more downtime) can figure out whether the second tower in each
      sector is inside or out, and which outside tower they should take.</p>

## Troubleshooting

      <p>It's much easier to identify the two safe sectors from the edge of the
      arena, as opposed to towards the center.</p>

      wide vantage over the whole arena.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Strength of the Ward]</b> The tanks are having trouble taking the tethers
  and making it to the safe spot in time without using <em>Sprint</em>!
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>It may make sense for the tanks to stand right next to the knights to
      take the tethers, however, the problem is that they have a long distance
      to cover to reach their final position to criss-cross the tethers.</p>
      <p>While you <em>can</em> use <em>Sprint</em> to help with this, an
      easier method is to stand towards North instead of besides the knight.</p>
      <p>Because the tethers initially tether to two players that are not
      targeted by <em>Skyward Leap</em>, the players with the tethers will be
      heading north anyway, and the tanks can let the players bring the tethers
      to them instead.</p>
      <p>This lets the tanks stay near their final positions, reducing the
      distance they have to travel.</p>

  <b>[Sanctity of the Ward]</b> Any tips for cursed towers?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Because there will be at least five towers on the outside, there will
      <em>always</em> be a non-cursed pair of positions.</p>
      <p>The problem is that this pair of positions isn't necessarily North and
      South. If you have voice comms, you can try to communicate that the
      Meteor pairs should go East and West instead, although this is rarely
      done.</p>
      <p>There are 90 notches around the arena. Assuming you have the cursed
      (120 degrees) tower pattern, you have 30 notches to put seven gaps
      between Meteors, which amounts to just over <b>four notches each</b>.</p>
