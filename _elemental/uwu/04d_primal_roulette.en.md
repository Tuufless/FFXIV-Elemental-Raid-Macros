# Primal Roulette

This is the final phase of the fight.

---

## Ultima #2

Ultima Weapon reappears in the center of the arena and starts casting another Ultima.

This **requires** a Tank LB3 to survive, which you should have rebuilt at this stage.

---

## Aetheric Boom

After the Ultima, quickly top up the party and prepare for *Aetheric Boom*.

Four tethered pairs of orbs will spawn. The tethers will pull the orbs together
and will wipe the party if they touch.

The length of the tether is determined by **the number of players** that took
the green Aetheroplasm orbs during *Ultimate Annihilation*.

- 1st Aetheroplasm Orb → NW tether
- 2nd Aetheroplasm Orb → NE tether
- 3rd Aetheroplasm Orb → SE tether
- 4th Aetheroplasm Orb → SW tether

Since the last two orbs in *Ultimate Annihilation* were taken solo by the MT,
these two pairs will have the shortest tether, so we start from the southern
orbs.

## Primal Roulette

Ultima Weapon will apply three *Viscous Aetheroplasm* debuffs on three random
players to mark the start of the Primal Roulette.

Some things to take note:

- The *Viscous Aetheroplasms* will each go off during the upcoming Primal
  sequences, essentially forcing the party to move together as a group.
- The Primals will then do their signature attack *(Aerial Blast, Hellfire, 
  Earthern Fury)* to mark the end of their sequence. However, because they are
  **not targetable**, you **will not** be able to use targeted mitigations like
  *Reprisal* or *Addle* to mitigate the damage.

A recommended mitigation plan is as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>First primal</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, H2 30s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Second primal</b></td>
    <td>H2 90s, D3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Third primal</b></td>
    <td>ST 90s, H2 30s</td>
  </tr>
</table>

While you can simply observe and react to whichever Primal appears, the order
is not completely random. Once you see the first Primal, the other two are
determined:

- Garuda → Ifrit → Titan *or*
- Ifrit → Garuda → Titan *or*
- Titan → Ifrit → Garuda

### Garuda

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Garuda readies a <em>Wicked Wheel</em> from the center of
      the arena.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> <em>Quickly</em> dodge into the <em>Wicked Wheel</em> AoE to
      avoid the follow-up <em>Wicked Tornado</em>.</p>
      <p>One <em>Viscous Aetheroplasm</em> debuff will go off around this time.</p>
    </td>
    <td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>4.</b> Titan then casts <em>Earthern Fury</em>, before jumping.</p>
      <p>Return North and prepare for the next Primal.</p>

Once all three Primal sequences are complete, Ultima Weapon will teleport to
the North of the arena and begin rapidly charging up the Ultima Aether gauge.

When the Ultima Aether gauge reaches 100, party members will be incapacitated
one-by-one, starting from the player that did the least damage to the player
that did the most.

This serves as Ultima Weapon's enrage, although note that there are still a few
seconds for DoTs to tick even after the last player has been defeated.
