# Garuda

The party begins facing against Garuda. 

However, the first three phases of UWU have one key mechanic that affects how
the party will resolve mechanics.

---

## Waking the Primals

The defining characteristic of the first three phases (Garuda, Ifrit, Titan) is
that each of the bosses must be "woken" by the party.

By executing a mechanic in a particular (generally harder) manner, the boss
will get one stack of *Aetherically Charged*.

When a boss gets four stacks of *Aetherically Charged*, they become "Woken",
which does the following:

- Certain attacks are changed or modified when the boss is woken.
- When defeated, a woken boss will leave behind a light puddle that will give 
  a player a *Beyond Limits* buff when stepped on.
- When a player with *Beyond Limits* uses an LB3, the buff will be consumed and
  the LB gauge refilled to LB3.
- A caster, a healer, and a melee **must** have this buff to clear the 
  transition to Ultima Weapon.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> Correctly waking up the three primals and getting the 
  <em>Beyond Limits</em> buff is only relevant <em>after</em> Titan.</p>
  <p>If you are still progging the first three phases and miss waking a
  primal, don't worry about it and continue trying to progress through the 
  encounter.</p>
</div>

## Waking Garuda

*Thermal Low* is a debuff that is applied on a player as a result of certain 
mechanics:

1. Spiny Plume's tankbuster *(Cyclone)*
2. Garuda's *Friction*

These stacks are then cleansed in two places:

1. Entering a bubble left behind when the Spiny Plume is destroyed.
2. Taking Mesohigh tethers from Chirada and Suparna ("the sisters").

When a player's *Thermal Low* stacks are cleansed, the party will take
raid-wide damage *(Super Cyclone)* depending on the number of stacks cleansed:

- If **one** stack is cleansed, the party takes minor damage.
- If **two** stacks are cleansed, the party takes a lot of damage.
- If **three** or more stacks are cleansed, the party takes lethal damage.

**Garuda gains a stack of *Aetherically Charged* when a player cleanses at 
least two stacks of Thermal Low.**

The following mechanics will also change when Garuda is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wicked Wheel</td>
    <td>Point-blank AoE.</td>

    cast-time or telegraph <em>(Wicked Tornado)</em>.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Downburst</td>
    <td>Frontal cleave that's taken by the MT.</td>

    <td>Adds that tether and close in to random players. They must be destroyed 
    before they cast a raid-wide <em>Sleep</em>.</td>
    <td>Turns to Razor Plumes that circle around the outer edge of the arena. 
    They will eventually home in on players and explode with a lethal AoE unless 
    they are blown using wind attacks such as <em>Wicked Tornado</em> or 
    <em>Super Cyclone</em>.</td>

## Friction

This is the major mechanic in Garuda, and is where the party will set Garuda up 
to be woken later on. Note that unlike Ifrit and Titan, Garuda will not 
*actually* be awoken after this mechanic, but we will do most of the legwork here.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>8.</b> After the Spiny Plume hits the ST for a second time (giving 
      them a second stack of <em>Thermal Low</em>), destroy it. This will cause 
      the Spiny Plume to explode in a telegraphed AoE, leaving behind a bubble.</p>
      <p>The later the Spiny Plume is destroyed, the more time the party has to
      execute the upcoming mechanics. However, destroying the Spiny Plume too 
      late will give the ST a third stack of <em>Thermal Low</em>, which will 
      wipe the raid.</p>

        <li><b>Outside:</b> D1, D2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the ST enters the bubble, their <em>Thermal Low</em> stacks will be

      <em>Aetherically Charged</em>.</p>

      <p>Garuda will cast <em>Friction</em> on a random player. This is a small 
      AoE that will give all players hit one stack of <em>Thermal Low</em>; the 
      players inside the bubble will have their stack immediately cleansed.</p>

Note that Garuda only has three of the four stacks needed to wake her.

## Waking Garuda

This is the last part of Garuda's phase, and is where the party will give 
Garuda the fourth stack of *Aetherically Charged*, waking her.

<table>

When a woken Garuda is defeated, a light puddle will appear under her. When a 
player steps into this puddle, they will receive a *Beyond Limits* buff.

When a player with *Beyond Limits* uses an LB3, the buff will be consumed and

relevant much later into the fight (from Ultimate Annihilation onwards).
