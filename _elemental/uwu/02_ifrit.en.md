# Ifrit

Depending on your tank composition (e.g: PLD + GNB) and the party's DPS
(whether you skip dashes), you may have to adjust how you tank Ultima Weapon
later.

Ifrit will also need to be "awakened" in order for the party to make it to
Ultima Weapon.

---

## Waking Ifrit

*Infernal Nails* can be hit by baited *Violent Eruptions*. When a Nail is hit by 
an *Eruption*, it gains a stack (max two) and increases in size.

Each stack it receives does the following:

* Lowers the damage taken by about 10%.
* Increases the raid-wide damage dealt when the nail is destroyed.

**Ifrit gains a stack of "Aetherically Charged" when an Infernal Nail with two 
stacks is destroyed.**

The following mechanics will also change when Ifrit is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crimson Cyclone</td>
    <td>Straight-line dash, going clockwise.</td>
    <td>Straight-line dash, in the order the <em>Infernal Nails</em> were 
    destroyed in, <b>followed by a cross-shaped AoE 45 degrees to the dash</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Flaming Crush</td>
    <td>Split damage.</td>
    <td>
      <p>Split damage that <b>also afflicts a heavy <em>Accursed Flame</em> 
      DoT</b> whose duration decreases as more players are hit.</p>
      <p>This should be shared by <b>at least 6 players</b> for minimum impact.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **ST** will take hate at the start of the fight.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Have the <b>ST</b> tank Ifrit facing south, with the party 
      North.</p>
      <p>Ifrit will open with <em>Hellfire</em> (heavy raid damage), and shortly 
      follow up with a <em>Vulcan Burst</em>.</p>
      <p><em>Vulcan Burst</em> is a large knockback, (just under half the arena) 
      that can be nullified by <em>Arm's Length/Surecast</em>, or by sufficient 
      shields as the knockback only applies if the player takes damage.</p>
      <p>H2's shields will nullify <em>Vulcan Burst's</em> damage, <b>unless H2 
      is weakened.</b></p>
      <p>Ifrit will then use three <em>Incinerates</em> in a row.
      <em>Incinerate</em> is a conal tankbuster that also applies a <em>Fire 
      Resistance Down</em> debuff on anyone hit.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>ST:</b> Invuln all three Incinerates.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(The "proper way" to do this would be to tank swap twice, once 
      between each Incinerate)</em>.</p>
      <p>Once all three <em>Incinerates</em> are done, the MT <em>Provokes</em> 
      and takes over.</p>

## Infernal Nails

This is Ifrit's major mechanic, and where we will wake Ifrit.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>2.</b> Four <em>Infernal Nails</em> will spawn in a trapezium 
      formation, in a <b>random</b> orientation.</p>
      <p>Ifrit will also target one <b>random healer</b> and apply a <em>Searing
      Wind</em> debuff on that healer.</p>
      <p>Take up positions as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> Bring Ifrit between the two close Nails (the top of the 
        trapezium). <b>Remember where this is.</b></li>
        <li><b>D3/D4:</b> Position yourselves beside the bottom-left and 
        bottom-right Nails, about 135 degrees from the MT.</li>
        <li><b>Healer with Searing Wind:</b> Stand opposite the MT.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/uwu/02/ifrit_02.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>3.</b> The two furthest players from Ifrit (except for the 
      <em>Searing Wind</em>) will bait two sets of four <em>Violent
      Eruptions</em>. These should be D3 and D4.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>D3/D4:</b> Bait <em>Violent Eruptions</em>. The first two 
          <em>Eruptions</em> should hit the bottom-left/right <em>Infernal Nail</em>.</p>
          <p>The last two <em>Eruptions</em> should hit the top two 
          <em>Infernal Nails</em>. <em>(This gives some backup in case one 
          player is slow and misses the fourth Nail.)</em></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </td>
	<td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/uwu/02/ifrit_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>4.</b> When an <em>Infernal Nail</em> gets hit by a second 
      <em>Violent Euprtion</em> (gaining two stacks), destroy them.</p>
      <p>The Nails should be destroyed in a "Reverse-Z" order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bottom-right</li>
        <li>Bottom-left</li>
        <li>Top-right</li>
        <li>Top-left</li>
      </ol>
      <p>As the Nails take less damage as they grow in size, it is a good idea to 
      lower their HP (without destroying them) while they are small.</p>
      <p>When a Nail is destroyed, the party will take raid-wide damage, and 
      momentality take extra damage, so be sure to give time to recover some HP 
      in between.</p>
      <p>One <b>random DPS</b> will also be chained to whoever is second in 
      aggro with <em>Infernal Fetters</em>. This chain applies a DoT, lowers 
      damage dealt by the chained players, and increases damage taken by the 
      chained players.</p>
      <p>These effects increase as the chain gets longer, although it's 
      effectively negligible.</p>
      <p><b>Remember where the fourth Nail is, as this will be the starting
      position for dodging Ifrit's dashes later.</b></p>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/uwu/02/ifrit_04.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Done correctly, Ifrit will get four stacks of *Aetherically Charged* (one for 
each Nail), and will wake, exclaiming "The flames hunger for thee, mortal!".

Ifrit will also start glowing **blue** (which will be important later).

## Crimson Cyclone #1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>5.</b> Ifrit returns with a <em>Hellfire</em> (heavy raid-wide 
      damage).</p>
      <p>After that, Ifrit will then target a <b>random healer</b> with another

      <p>Have the party take up positions as follows:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>The healer with the first Searing Wind:</b> Rotate back clockwise 
        to end up bottom-left of the party (~135 degrees)</li>
        <li><b>The healer with the new Searing Wind:</b> Move to the 
        bottom-right, away from the party (~135 degrees)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ifrit will also target a random player with a Woken <em>Flaming
      Crush</em>, which should be taken as a 6-man stack.</p>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/uwu/02/ifrit_08.jpg">

If the party's DPS is good, you can defeat Ifrit by this point, skipping the 
second set of *Crimson Cyclone* dashes.

## Crimson Cyclone #2

Four Ifrits will spawn on the outside of the arena- three of these are clones, 
but one is the real Ifrit (who will be glowing blue).

This is important, because the real Ifrit (who is woken) will have an afterburn 
that is an untelegraphed, X-shaped AoE 45 degrees from the original dash.

The four Ifrits will **dash in the same order the Nails were destroyed**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>9.</b> Move to where the fourth Nail was. The healer with
      <em>Searing Wind</em> will be diretly opposite the party.</p>
      <p><b>Look for the Ifrit that is glowing blue.</b></p>
      <p>Everybody will run in an anti-clockwise direction to <b>end 90 or 180 
      degrees from the blue Ifrit</b>.</p>
      <p>The party will <em>always</em> have to move into either one or two 
      dashes to do this.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, the blue Ifrit is where the fourth Nail was, and 
      the party will be moving twice.)</em></p>
