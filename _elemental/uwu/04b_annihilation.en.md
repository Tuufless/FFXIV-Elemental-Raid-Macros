Ultima Weapon will then disappear and then reappear where it stands (arena
North), and begin *Ultimate Annihilation*.

## Ultimate Annihilation (2211)

This phase is unique among all the "Trio"-like mechanics in all Ultimate fights
as Ultima Weapon will actually be targetable during this sequence.

In this section, there will be four green Aetheroplasm orbs for the party to 
take- how you resolve these orbs affects the *Aetheric Boom* mechanic towards
the end of the fight.

Of note, these orbs will always spawn on Ultima Weapon's left leg (the 
south-east corner).

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>9.</b> Start stacked together on the South-West corner of Ultima
      Weapon.</p>
      <p>There will be three <em>Weight of the Lands</em>, accompanied with a
      <em>Flaming Crush</em> stack.</p>

      <p><b>11.</b> Third set of <em>Weight of the Land</em>, which is also 
      when the <em>Flaming Crush</em> resolves.</p>
      <p>The party will need to split up as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT, ST:</b> Move east to take the first Aetheroplasm orb.</li>
        <li><b>H1, H2:</b> Move west.</li>

      <em>Mesohigh</em> tether resolves.</p>
      <p>Note this is a lot of outgoing damage and should be mitigated, as the
      healer taking the <em>Mesohigh</em> tether will also trigger additional
      raid-wide damage.</p>
      <p>Finally, Garuda jumps <em>(Dodge Feather Rains)</em>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> Take the fourth <em>Aetheroplasm</em> orb solo.</li>

After the *Feather Rains*, Ultima Weapon momentarily disappears, marking the 
end of this phase.

## Aetheroplasm Orbs

The number of people that are hit by the *Aetheroplasm Orbs* determine the time
the party has to take the four pairs of orbs later on in *Aetheric Boom*.

- 1st: NW orb
- 2nd: NE orb
- 3rd: SE orb
- 4th: SW orb

The more players that are hit increases the distance between the two orbs, 
giving the party more time to resolve them.

However, each person hit also increases the Ultima Aether gauge by 1.
