# Ultimate Predation

Ultima Weapon now shows up for the party to take down.

There are four main "blocks" in Ultima Weapon's timeline, that culminates in a
signature mechanic, the first of which is *Ultimate Predation*.

However, there are first a couple points to discuss.

---

## Ultima Aether

When the fight resumes, there will now be a new "Ultima Aether" gauge that 
serves as a timer to Ultima's enrage. When the gauge reaches 100, Ultima begins
its enrage sequence.

Ultima Aether is built:

- When Ultima Weapon performs certain actions. (+2 Aether)
- When players get hit by Aetheroplasm (green) orbs. (+1 Aether for each player 
  hit)
- **When a player dies.** (+4 Aether for each death)

This last point is particularly noteworthy, as player deaths effectively bring
the enrage **forward** in addition to weakness.

---

## Pre-Predation

Ultima opens with a Tank Purge (raid-wide AoE). During this time, the two tanks
should establish themselves as the top two players in hate.

In particular, the MT should be first in aggro, while the ST should be second.
There is not a lot of time to do this, so be careful that the ST doesn't 
accidentally take hate from the MT.

    <td width="50%">

      around the player who is highest in hate (which should be the MT).</p>

        a <em>Viscous Aetheroplasm</em> debuff.</li>

## Ultimate Predation

This is the first "Trio" combo of mechanics you'll see.

Remember that all the primals have been woken, so they will all do the Woken 
versions of their mechanics.

- **Garuda**: Spawns in a random quadrant, slightly offset diagonally from the 
  center.
- **Ifrit**: Spawns in a random intercardinal position.
- **Titan**: Spawns in a random cardinal, shifted slightly left or right.
- **Ultima**: Spawns in a random intercardinal position.

Because of Garuda's Wicked Wheel â†’ Wicked Tornado combo, only the quadrant 
diagonally opposite Garuda will be safe to resolve this mechanic.

There are **two methods** to resolving Ultimate Predation, but both methods
follow the same rules:

1. Move to the quadrant diagonally opposite Garuda.
2. Be away from Titan.
3. Move away from Ultima.

## Method 1 - Cheesing Predation

This is my preferred method, and is actually the Japanese standard strat on Mana
DC and Gaia DC.

The idea *isn't* actually to resolve Predation cleanly- instead, we want to
**get the party hit by Ifrit's afterburn with mitigations**.

Observe there are "rune" marks that line the outside of the arena. The party 
needs to dodge Titan's *Landslide* and Ifrit's first *Crimson Cyclone* dash, 
but end up **between the outside runes** (basically at a cardinal position) to 
get hit by the second afterburn from *Crimson Cyclone*.

(If Ultima Weapon is on an adjacent intercardinal, be on the half **away** 
from Ultima Weapon.)

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/uwu/04a/between_runes.jpg)

This would ordinarily deal lethal damage to the party, but because the party
survives the damage with migitations, limit break is generated as a result.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
The party needs <b>shields <em>and</em> three additional pieces of mitigation</b>
(H2 30s, a tank 90s, and D3) to survive the afterburn.
</div>

It might seem odd to do this method, especially as dodging the AoEs normally
isn't particularly difficult. However, the **real** objective is to
artificially generate limit break in a consistent manner, which then
*guarantees* the party will have LB3 available for Ultima #2.

## Method 2 - Dodging Predation

The other way to resolve *Ultimate Predation* is to simply dodge all the
Primal's AoEs.

This was the way to resolve *Ultimate Predation* when the fight was current-
however, because *The Weapon's Refrain* has been outscaled over the years,
**you risk not having LB3 at the end of *Ultimate Suppression*, automatically 
leading to a wipe**.

Observe there are "rune" marks that line the outside the arena- **four runes
from a cardinal direction** will dodge Ifrit's and Titan's second set of 
mechanics, which just leaves Garuda and Ultima to manage:

### Building LB at Tank Purge

If the group decides to dodge *Ultimate Predation*, there may be a need to
artificially generate LB to avoid reaching Ultima #2 without an LB3.

This method involves **not** healing the party after the Tank LB3 that keeps 
the party alive after the first Ultima.

{% include youtube.html id="ZSXfmoIN2No" %}

The goal is to keep the party's HP low enough that they would die to the 
opening Tank Purge at the start of Ultima Weapon, but shields and mitigations 
keep them alive.

- Keep the party's HP below 15k (how much damage Tank Purge deals).
- The lower the party's HP, the more mitigations you will need to survive.
- Try not to debuff Ultima Weapon (Feint, Addle, Reprisal) if possible. Doing 
  so **lowers** Ultima Weapon's outgoing damage, which may lead to the party 
  surviving the raw damage instead (and not build LB as a result).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Ultimate Predation]</b> Why should we cheese <em>Ultimate Predation</em>
  instead of just dodging the AoEs normally?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The party needs to rebuild an LB3 by the end of <em>Ultimate
      Suppression</em> in order to survive the second <em>Ultima</em> cast
      towards the end of the fight.</p>
      <p><em>The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate)</em> unfortunately hasn't scaled
      very well over the expansions- players deal much higher damage compared
      to its release in Patch 4.3, and as a result, it is not uncommon to
      reach <em>Ultima</em> #2 <em>without</em> an LB3, leading to an immediate
      wipe, especially because <em>Ultimate Suppression</em> can be triggered
      early.</p>
      <p>This leads to a need to artifically generate Limit Break.</p>
      <p>While you <em>can</em> do so at the first <em>Tank Purge</em>, this
      method has some problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is easily ruined by a well-intentioned, but ignorant healer that
        heals the party up after <em>Ultima</em> #1.</li>
        <li>It's difficult to eyeball whether the current HP and shields are
        enough to keep the party alive from the <em>Tank Purge</em>. You cannot
        debuff the boss or risk not generating the limit break you need, and if
        you are going to spend party mitigations, you may as well mitigate 
        <em>Crimson Cyclone</em>'s afterburn instead.</li>
        <li>A SCH can <em>Adloquium â†’ Deployment Tactics</em> off a tank to keep
        the party's HP low, a SGE cannot (adding <em>Zoe</em> to <em>Eukrasian
        Prognosis</em> also heals the party up <em>more</em>!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thus, as far as consistency goes, simply mitigating the afterburn from
      <em>Crimson Cyclone</em> is the better approach.</p>
