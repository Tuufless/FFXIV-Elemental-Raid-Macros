# Ultimate Suppression

Unlike the other phases in this fight, you can push Ultima into *Ultimate
Suppression* early- *Ultimate Suppression* will start when Ultima Weapon
goes **under 50% HP**.

Note that you **must** have a Tank LB3 when *Ultimate Suppression* ends- if you
haven't built enough LB by this time, you may want to consider holding DPS to
buy more time.

---

## Pre-Suppression

The important part of this phase, **especially** if DPS has been low is to
shield the *Vulcan Bursts* to prevent them from knocking players out of the
arena.

## Ultimate Suppression

          targeted for a <em>Granite Gaol</em>- this player must still place
          their fourth Eruption behind the sister, but does not need to dodge
          out of it.</p>

      finishes casting Tank Purge.</p>
      <p>Again, because there is also a Mesohigh tether AoE going off at 
      this time, this is a lot of damage.</p>
      <p>The feathers will also explode in a point-blank

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Featherlance]</b> What causes the feathers to converge in on the party?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>This is actually a Woken Garuda mechanic that you can see in P1 if you
      cleanse <em>three sets</em> of <em>Thermal Low</em> stacks using the
      Spiny Plume's bubble instead of two.</p>
      <p>The feathers will all home in on party members, killing them- the way
      to prevent this is to knock them out of the air by cleansing and
      triggering a <em>Super Cyclone</em> by taking Garuda's tether <b>with a
      stack of <em>Thermal Low</em>.</b></p>
      <p>At this point, there should only be two people that can do this-
      either the MT, or the healer that did <em>not</em> get <em>Searing Wind</em>
      earlier during <em>Ultimate Annihilation</em>.</p>
