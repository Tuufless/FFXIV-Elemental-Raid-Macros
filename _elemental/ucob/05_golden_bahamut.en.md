# Golden Bahamut

This phase is often nicknamed the "victory lap" because it's by far the
simplest phase in the entire fight.

Phoenix revives the party, giving all party members full HP/MP, an LB3, and
the *Phoenix's Blessing* buff.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/ucob/05/phoenix_blessing.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><b>Phoenix's Blessing</b></p>
      <p><em>Damage dealt is increased.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Doubles the damage dealt by the player.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This buff is *lost* when a player dies, thus increasing the consequences of
dying in this phase (especially if a DPS dies early in the phase).

Bahamut reappears, and transforms into Golden Bahamut.

If Bahamut was not previously brought down to below 60% HP, Golden Bahamut will 
start the phase with a 5x damage-up buff *("Bahamut grows mightier still!")*
that make this phase impossible to clear with a standard party composition.

The final phase consists of three mechanics on a loop:

1. Morn Afah (party stack)
2. Akh Morn (shared tankbuster)
3. Exaflares

This loop repeats five times in total, although the order for *Morn Afah* and 
*Akh Morn* is switched **only for the second iteration.**

## Mitigations

This phase requires planning out and coordinating mitigations. The recommended 
base mitigation is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #1</b></td>
    <td><p>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, H2 shields, H2 30s, D1, D4</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #2</b></td>
    <td>ST 90s, MT Reprisal, H2 shields, H2 30s, D3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #3</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, D1, D4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #4</b></td>
    <td>MT Reprisal, ST 90s, D2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Morn Afah #5</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, D3, D4</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Some things to consider:

- AST has an extra cooldown you can use to help shore up missing mitigation.
- Golden Bahamut's DPS check is (very) lenient now. Consider Tank LB to help 
  mitigate Morn Afah if anything goes wrong.

Tanks will also need to plan out their cooldowns for the Akh Morns.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #1</b></td>
    <td><p>MT + ST stack, Rampart + 30% + short</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #2</b></td>
    <td>MT invuln</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #3</b></td>
    <td>ST invuln</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Akh Morn #4</b></td>
    <td>MT + ST stack, Rampart + 30% + short</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>6.</b> Golden Bahamut casts Akh Morn on the MT.</p>
      <p>Note that the party stays <b>at the edge</b>, while the tank(s) <b>are towards the center</b>.</p>
      <p><em>This will be Morn Afah in all future iterations.</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/ucob/05/golden_bahamut_06.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>7.</b> Golden Bahamut then targets a random (non-tank) player with Morn Afah.</p>
      <p><em>This will be Akh Morn in all future iterations.</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/ucob/05/golden_bahamut_07.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The above loop repeats four more times before Golden Bahamut casts a final 
*Morn Afah*, targeting players one at a time (in order of descending hate) to 
serve as the hard enrage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[General]</b> Can Golden Bahamut be cleared with the damage-up buff?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Yes, in the sense that it's been done.</p>
      {% include youtube.html id="0ivLvPhZ7DQ" %}
      <p>It took a party of five tanks cycling through Golden Bahamut just
      to survive the auto-attacks, all of which will one-shot a tank (it
      deals about 150% of a tank's max HP!). Golden Bahamut's auto-attacks
      can also crit, which would practically one-shot a tank through full
      mitigation and shields.</p>
      <p>Four tanks would invuln the four <em>Akh Morn</em>s, with heavy
      shielding (SCH + SGE) and a Tank LB3 to survive every other <em>Morn
      Afah</em>, sacrificing the stack target for the ones in between.</p>
      <p>Success was heavily dependent on RNG- recovering from a tank dying to
      <em>Morn Afah</em> without having cycled in to mitigate Golden Bahamut's
      auto-attacks, was extremely difficult to impossible in some scenarios.</p>
