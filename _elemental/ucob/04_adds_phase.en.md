# Twintania + Nael deus Darnus

Commonly referred to as the "adds phase", this phase can be intimidating at 
first, but it's actually **less** chaotic compared to Nael's phase near the 
start of the fight.

This phase is essentially a loop repeated twice:

1. Plummet/Bahamut's Claw
2. Liquid Hell
3. Hatches → Twisters
4. Nael's line → Twisters
5. Megaflare → Death Sentence/Ravensbeak *(this swaps order on the second loop)*

An Aethertrial Attunement gauge will appear as an enrage timer, although this 
can be ignored- it will naturally fill a few seconds after the second loop has 
completed.

## Quotes

There are four possible quotes Nael will use in this phase. Note that the first 
mechanic will always be either Lunar Dynamo, or Iron Chariot.

This is important, because Nael will always start with the opposite mechanic in 
the second loop.

Nael's lines will include a combination of *Lunar Dynamo, Iron Chariot, Raven's 
Dive*, and *Thermionic Beam*.

Note that because Nael is at the edge of the arena, ranged players can outrange 
the *Lunar Dynamo*.

The loop then repeats from *Plummet/Bahamut's Claw*.

The second loop has the following differences from the first:

- If Nael started with *Lunar Dynamo* the first time around, she will start 
  with *Iron Chariot* in the second iteration (and vice-versa).
- *Megaflare* comes before the tank swap in the first loop, but the tank swap 
  comes first in the second loop.

Twintania and Nael must be killed at the same time. If either one of them dies, 
the other immediately starts casting *Twin Fury/White Fury*, which is a 
3-second enrage cast that refills their HP to full.

To help with this, caster LB or ranged LB when both their HP is at 1%.

If successful, Bahamut's *Teraflare* will wipe the party, but Phoenix will
revive the party with full HP/MP (just like a healer LB3), and refill the limit 
break gauge with an LB3.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b> Like a Healer LB3, Phoenix's raise will reset any weakness status 
players may have- if a player dies just before the phase ends, it may be worth 
not raising them so they are raised by Phoenix without weakness.</div>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Twintania + Nael]</b> The starting HP% are different- should one boss be 
  prioritized over the other?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Not really. Twintania has more max HP than Nael, but the two 
      bosses start the phase with roughly the same HP (Nael starts with 
      negligibly more HP than Twintania), which is why Nael's starting HP% is 
      higher</p>
