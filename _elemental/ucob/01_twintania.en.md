# Twintania

Twintania's mechanics start with a basic loop that slowly gets more elaborate
as the fight progresses. This phase can be broken down into three sub-phases,
each pushed by Twintania's HP.

---

## Part 1: 100% HP - 75% HP

Twintania's first phase is a basic introduction to what to expect- Twisters, 
and the Fireball stack. The phase lasts until Twintania is pushed below 75% HP.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Pull Twintania over the NW marker, and point it away from 
      the party so Plummet doesn't hit anyone else.</p>
      <p>Have the rest of the party spread out, but make sure all party 
      members (except for the tanks) have a clear path to Twintania's rear.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/ucob/01/twintania_1_1.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> Twintania will mark one random (non-tank) player with a 
      Fireball marker, and cast Twister.</p><p>All players will bait Twisters
      where they stand.</p>
      <p>While doing so, all players except the tanks and D3 moves to stack
      together behind Twintania to split Fireball's damage in a 5-man stack.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>D3: </b> Stay out of the Fireball stack unless you are the
        Fireball target.</li>
        <li><b>D4: </b>Join the Fireball stack unless D3 is the Fireball
        target.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will need to mitigate this Fireball to survive- use effects like
      shields, <em>Sacred Soil/Kerachole</em> and
      <em>Troubadour/Tactician/Shield Samba</em>.</p>
      <p><b>Do not</b> use debuffs like <em>Reprisal, Feint, or Addle</em>.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>3.</b> Twintania then uses Death Sentence, a single-target
      tankbuster that also applies a slashing damage debuff, thus mandating a
      tank swap. The loop then repeats from Plummet (with the MT and ST
      swapped).</p>
      <p><em>(Most groups will push Twintania into the next phase without
      seeing the second Fireball.)</em></p>

</table>

## Part 2: 74% HP - 45% HP

This second phase builds upon the mechanics introduced in the first, adding
*Liquid Hell* and *Hatches* to the mix.

The phase ends when Twintania is pushed below 45% HP.

      Twintania (if nobody is further than 15 yalms, Twintania targets a random
      player).</p>

      players don't get hit.</p>

      player cannot be hit by a second orb- this does not do anything now, but
      will be relevant later.</p>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Fireballs]</b> Why do only 5 people stack for the Fireballs at the start
  of the fight?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is to help build LB.</p>
      <p>To make the transition from Nael to Bahamut, there must be at least a
      tank LB2 to keep the party alive. However, as the DPS check has gotten
      easier over time, there's a chance that insufficient LB will be built if
      the whole party split the <em>Fireball</em> damage.</p>
      <p>The <em>Fireball</em> stacks in the last phase are resolved with the
      full party as it's not worth wiping the party to insufficient
      players/mitigations unless the healers know what they are doing.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Fireballs]</b> Why does D3 stay out of the initial <em>Fireball</em>
  stack, instead of D4 who would have to cast and move?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is done to keep D3's HP high as they will be baiting <em>Liquid
      Hell</em> shortly after.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Fireballs]</b> Why don't we debuff Twintania with
  <em>Reprisal/Feint/Addle</em> at the first <em>Fireball</em> stack?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>LB is built whenever someone in the party survives damage that is 
      equal to, or greater than their current HP due to mitigation or
      shields.</p>
      <p>By splitting the <em>Fireball</em> damage between just five players
      instead of eight, we intentionally "kill" the five players, but save them
      through shields and mitigations, thus building LB.</p>
      <p>However, there is some fine print- the order of operations are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply debuffs to reduce outgoing damage <em>(Addle, Dismantle, 
        Feint, Reprisal)</em></li>
        <li><b>Generate LB if damage is equal to or greater than current HP</b></li>
        <li>Apply mitigations to reduce incoming damage <em>(Aquaveil,
        Kerachole, Sacred Soil, Third Eye, etc.)</em></li>
        <li>Absorb damage from shields <em>(Divine Veil, Shade Shift, Succor, 
        etc.)</em></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If enough debuffs are applied at Step 1, the damage at Step 2 is
      <em>no longer lethal</em>, and thus <em>LB is not generated</em>, thus
      defeating the purpose of a 5-man <em>Fireball</em> stack in the first
      place.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Hatch + Liquid Hell]</b> The orb takes too long to get to me and I end up
  standing in a fire puddle and dying. What's wrong?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The orbs start moving towards the players before Twintania starts the 
      <em>Liquid Hells</em>. During this time, the orbs are supposed to reach
      the players inside the Neurolinks.</p>
      <p>If they are taking too long, either the targeted players are curving
      the orbs too much (increasing their travel distance), or the Neurolinks
      are too far from Twintania (the markers are placed too far apart).</p>
