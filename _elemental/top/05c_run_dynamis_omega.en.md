# Run: Dynamis (Omega Version)

Run: Dynamis (Omega Version) can be split down into the following three blocks:

1. [Dodging AoEs](#1-dodging-aoes)
2. [Hello, World #1 with Oversampled Wave Cannon](#2-first-hello-world-with-monitors)
3. [Hello, World #2 with tethers](#3-second-hello-world-with-tethers)

## 1. Dodging AoEs

Unlike Delta and Sigma, Omega-F will stay on the arena during this part of Run
Dynamis (Omega Version).

The party will need to dodge two Omega-M/F AoE combos (like *Party Synergy*
from P2) in combination with *Diffuse Wave Cannon* from Omega Reconfigured in
the center.

To help, observe that there will *always* be a safe spot along a **cardinal**
direction, either **near, middle, or far** away from the center.

- Look at Omega-F. If Omega-F is blade-legs, the safe spot will *always* be
  along a cardinal direction **near the center**.
    - Look at Omega-M. If Omega-M is holding a sword, move **away** from Omega-M.
    - Otherwise, Omega-M is holding a shield. Move **towards** Omega-M.
- Otherwise, Omega-F is holding a staff, and a safe spot will *always* be
  along a cardinal direction **towards Omega-M**.
    - Look at Omega-M. If Omega-M is holding a sword, move **far** from the
      center.
    - Otherwise, Omega-M is holding a shield. Move **mid-way** from the center.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>M Sword, F Blade-legs</b> <em>(Away from M, near)</em></p>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05c/run_dynamis_omega_03d.jpg">
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><b>M Shield, F Blade-legs</b> <em>(Towards M, near)</em></p>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05c/run_dynamis_omega_03a.jpg">

      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05c/run_dynamis_omega_03b.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

For the first set of Omega-M/F AoEs, this process will leave two possible safe spots to choose from.

When Final Omega's lights glow in the center, one of the two cardinal 
directions will be eliminated, leaving only one cardinal to go to.

The safe spot for the second set of AoEs will *always* be 90 degrees from
the first safe spot *(determine whether you're going to move cw or ccw, and whether to go near, mid, or far)*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Final Omega will spawn in the center.</p>
      <p>An Omega-M/F pair will spawn at opposite intercardinal positions,
      again with a random Sword/Shield and Staff/Blade-Legs combo.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, the safe spot will be near the middle, either
      North or West.)</em></p>

      two safe directions identified earlier.</p>
      <p>This must be resolved together with the first Omega-M/F pair's AoEs.</p>
      <p>Use this time to identify the next safe spot.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, the Diffuse Wave Cannon eliminates the West safe
      spot, leaving only North, near the center.)</em></p>

      two cardinal directions, which must be resolved together with the second
      Omega-M/F pair's AoEs.</p>
      <p><b>Sprint is highly recommended if the party needs to run from, or run 
      to a far position.</b></p>
      <p><em>(In this example, the party rotates 90 degrees clockwise, and goes

  <p><b>Note:</b> Pay attention to the MT, as Omega-F will continue to 
  auto-attack during this whole sequence, and tanks cannot use major cooldowns
  to mitigate the damage because of the upcoming Solar Ray.</p>

## 2. First Hello, World with Monitors

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>5.</b> Omega will then present a single monitor set <b>either West 
      or East</b>, to be resolved together with the first set of <em>Hello, 
      World</em> debuffs.</p>
      <p>Omega's monitors will be taken by two players with <b>two Dynamis
      stacks</b>.
      However:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Player(s) with two Dynamis stacks and <em>Second in Line</em>
        <b>must</b> take Omega's monitors.</li>
        <li>Players(s) with <em>First in Line</em> <b>cannot</b> take Omega's
        monitors <em>(because they'll resolve their Hello, World
        instead)</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The remaining six players will resolve the <em>Hello, World</em>
      debuffs.</p>
      <p><em>In this example, H1, D2, D3, and D4 each have two stacks of
      Dynamis.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>D2 has Second in Line, so they <b>must</b> take Omega's
        monitor.</em></li>
        <li><em>H1 has First in Line, so they <b>cannot</b> take Omega's
        monitor.</em></li>
        <li><em>Either D3 or D4 can be the second player to take Omega's
        monitor.</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once everyone has taken up their positions, the player with <em>Hello,
      Near World</em> can move a little bit away from the player with
      <em>Hello, Distant World</em> to ensure <em>Hello, Near World</em> jumps
      to the correct players.</p>
      <p>Just like before, these two players should be standing one ring in
      front of the markers <em>(towards the center of the arena)</em>.</p>

      <p><b>6.</b> <em>Hello, World</em> debuffs resolve together with

      <p>Done correctly, there should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Two players with three Dynamis stacks.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>These players should <em>not</em> have the second set of

## 3. Second Hello, World with tethers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>7.</b> Omega then spawns at a random cardinal position, and tethers
      to two players. These are the same tethers from P1.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Players with 3 stacks:</b> Take the tethers and stand beside
        Omega.</li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Everybody else:</b> Resolve <em>Hello, World</em> debuffs.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, the player with <em>Hello, Near World</em> can move away from
      the player with <em>Hello, Distant World</em> to ensure <em>Hello, Near
      World</em> jumps to the correct players.</p>
      <p>Both <em>Hello, World</em> players should stand one ring in front of
      the markers <em>(towards the center of the arena)</em>.</p>

    <td>
      <p><b>8.</b> The two tethers resolve.</p>
      <p>The players that had the tethers and the <em>Hello, Distant World</em>
      player can adjust a little bit after the tethers resolve just to be sure
      the <em>Hello, Distant World</em> debuffs resolve correctly.</p>
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>9.</b> Shortly after, the <em>Hello, World</em> debuffs resolve.</p>

  </tr>

Omega-F then does one more set of *Solar Ray* tankbusters before casting
*Blind Faith*.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of
*Blind Faith*'s cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.

### Omega Automarkers

Like Sigma, It is common practice in Elemental DC to use Automarkers to assign
player positions to resolve *Hello, Near World* and *Hello, Distant World*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p>Follow these positions for the first set (during monitors).</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">
      <b>Omega's monitors face west</b>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <b>Omega's monitors face east</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05c/run_dynamis_omega_am1.jpg">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05c/run_dynamis_omega_am2.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p>Typically, the players marked "1" would be on the north side, but this
      really applies to only the two players at the extreme North and South
      positions.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Automarkers are used again for the final set of *Hello, Near World* and *Hello,
Distant World*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Follow these positions for the second set (during tethers).</p>
      <p>Who takes relative east/west doesn't particularly matter.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05c/run_dynamis_omega_am3.jpg">
