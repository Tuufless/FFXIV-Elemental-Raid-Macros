# Omega Reconfigured

This phase can be broken down into three sections:

- [Transition](#transition)
- [Hello World](#hello-world)
- [Oversampled Wave Cannon (Monitors)](#oversampled-wave-cannon)

---

## Transition

This is the only phase in the fight with a transition mechanic.

## Hello, World

Omega begins the phase with its signature *Hello, World* mechanic, which does
raid-wide damage, and applies a *lot* of debuffs on all players.

Although *Hello, World* may look overwhelming, only **two things are
relevant**:

1. What colour "Nisi" (*Critical Performance* and *Critical Underflow*) is
   paired with *Critical Overflow* and *Critical Synchronization*. This is
   determined when the debuffs appear, and will be fixed for the entire phase.
2. What debuff you currently have in the cycle (the *Local/Remote Regression* 
   tethers, or the *Critical Overflow/Synchronization* "Nisis").

These two rules then determine where everyone goes each loop:

- ***Critical Overflow/Synchronization* (the "Nisis")**
  - Players with *Critical Overflow* (the "Defamations") always take their
    coloured tower, standing towards the **outside**.
  - Players with *Critical Synchronization* always take their coloured tower,
    standing towards the **inside**.
- ***Local/Remote Regression* (the tethers)**
  - Players with the red/green tethers always stretch their tether, and stand
    beside the players **with *Critical Overflow*** (the "Defamations")
  - Players with the blue tethers always stand in between the players **with
    *Critical Synchronization***.

This then puts the party into one of the two formations below, depending on
whether *Critical Overflow* is paired with *Critical Performance* or
*Critical Underflow*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/hello_world_0_0a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/hello_world_0_0b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Blue is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
      has Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png"></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Red is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

When the *Critical Overflow/Synchronization Bugs* resolve, everyone in the
party takes damage, and we pass the *Critical Performance/Underflow* ("Nisis")
debuffs by having the tether players move to the players with
*Critical Performance/Underflow*.

The tethers will also become real, which we then resolve one by one:

1. First, break the blue tethers by having those players **move away** from
   each other *(this will naturally break when picking up Critical
   Performance/Underflow)*.
2. Then, break the red/green tethers by having those player **move towards**
   each other.

Thus, the full *Hello, World* sequence goes like this:

Once all steps have been completed, the party will find itself with different
debuffs to resolve, and the sequence repeats.

This loop is repeated four times (all players will have their go at each
debuff). However, the final iteration has one small difference where the *Local
Regression* players stand *with* the *Critical Synchronization Bugs* instead.

### Mitigation

One last thing to touch on will be party mitigation.

Each loop, the party will take raid-wide damage from the *Critical
Overflow/Synchronization* debuffs resolving, and the two tethers breaking.

The party needs **three pieces of mitigation** (shields count) to survive all
the damage from each loop *without* any healing in between.

As a baseline, I recommend the following mitigation:

Each of these will need the party topped to full, and *something* else from
the healers, whether it be *Succor/Eukrasian Prognosis*,
*Sacred Soil/Kerachole*, *Liturgy of the Bell/Macrocosmos*, etc.

Omega will also auto-attack the tanks in between loops, which should be
mitigated to alleviate strain on the healers. Consider tank-swapping around
the third set of towers to cycle through both tank's cooldowns.

We can now (finally) go over *Hello, World* in detail.

For brevity's sake, we will only display the relevant debuffs, and just the

  </tr>
</table>

All players rotate their roles for the next iteration, and repeat the loop.

### Fourth (final) iteration

There are **two key differences** for the final iteration:

1. Players with *Local Regression* <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/local_regression.png"> 
   will **join** the *Critical Synchronizations* <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
   instead of getting hit by *Critical Overflow* <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
   and will break **first**.
2. Players will **not** pass *Critical Underflow* <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png">
   and *Critical Performance* <img style="height:1em" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/03/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png">.

Also, because all players have gone through all other roles, they have the
Debugger buffs that prevent them from receiving *Critical Underflow Bug* and
*Critical Performance Bug* again (the Nisis).

Thus, this final set of towers is **free movement**, as the Nisis will not be 
passed, even if players bump into one another.

## Oversampled Wave Cannon

Omega will teleport to the middle and face north.

Monitors will appear on Omega's, and on three random player's left-hand or
right-hand side. For each of the four monitors (Omega and the three players),
two random players on the monitor's side will be hit with an AoE.

The party needs to arrange themselves such that all monitors hit exactly two
players each.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<summary>
  <b>[Local Regression]</b> Why do the Local Regression players not stand with
  the Critical Overflows in the final iteration?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Omega casts <em>Critical Error</em> at the end of Hello, World.</p>
      <p><em>Critical Error</em> isn't just raidwide damage- <b><em>Critical 
      Error</em> also gives all players a new <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>.</b></p>
      <p>However, because all players have the <em>Critical Overflow 
      Debugger</em> buff from resolving <em>Critical Overflow</em> earlier, 
      this additional <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> will be blocked.</p>
      <p>The <em>Local Regression</em> players at the fourth set of towers
      are the players that originally started with <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>
      with the first tower, so they already have the <em>Critical Overflow
      Debugger</em> buff from then.</p>
      <p>If they stayed with the <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> players in the
      final iteration, their <em>Critical Overflow Debugger</em> buffs would 
      get consumed at the fourth towers, and as a result, they won't have the 
      <em>Critical Overflow Debugger</em> buff when Omega casts <em>Critical 
      Error</em>, and will get another round of <em>Critical Overflow Bugs</em>.</p>
      <p>These <em>Critical Overflow Bugs</em> will resolve together with 
      <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em>, making <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em> 
      impossible to resolve.</p>

    <p>Putting healers at the north side means that both extremeties will have

    north-most monitor player in particular.</p>

      <p>However, the problem with going horizontally is that if you're off by
      a little bit, there's a chance you accidentally clip the player on the
      far East/West (marked "3"). It doesn't help that Omega in the center is
      blocking your view of that player.</p>
      <p>One of the advantages of Astoh's strat is that each monitor player can
      clearly see the <b>two</b> other players they are supposed to hit with
      their monitors (without Omega in the way). Tilting up/down a little gives
      you additional margin of error to not hit the player at "3"- you can tilt
      as much as you want, so long as you still hit the two people you're
      supposed to (who aren't blocked by Omega).</p>

## Troubleshooting

<summary>
  <b>[Cascading Latent Defect/Latent Performance Defect]</b> Why did we wipe to
  this even though we took the towers correctly?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is the result of <em>Cascading Latent Defect</em> or <em>Latent
      Performance Defect</em> expiring without getting cleansed.</p>
      <p>This means that either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A red/blue tower was taken without the same-coloured Nisi
        <em>or</em></li>
        <li>The Nisi was taken too late in the previous round.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Taking the towers gives players a 10-second <em>Cascading Latent 
      Defect</em> or <em>Latent Performance Defect</em> debuffs, which need to
      be cleaned by the appropriate Bug (the Nisis) debuffs by having them
      <b>expire before the Defects</b>.</p>
      <p>The timeline for each loop looks like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>T+0s:</b> Towers resolve.</li>
        <li><b>T+21s:</b> Next towers resolve and apply Defects.</li>
        <li><b>T+31s:</b> Defects resolve, wiping the raid.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since the Nisi debuffs last 27 seconds and must expire before the
      Defects do, this means you have a 3-4 second window after towers resolve
      to pass Nisis (Note: <em>not</em> necessarily break tethers!) for the
      Nisis to expire in time to cleanse the next tower's Defects.</p>
      <p>If you miss this window, your Nisi will not expire in time to cleanse
      the Defects before they explode and wipe the raid.</p>

  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> A <em>Critical Overflow</em> AoE went off
  during monitors! What happened?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>Critical Error</em> has an additional effect besides just
      raid-wide damage- it gives <em>all</em> party members a
      <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em> debuff.</p>
      <p>However, in normal cases, all party members would have the
      <em>Overflow Debugger</em> buff on them from resolving <em>Critical
      Error</em> previously. This buff is <em>lost</em> if the player dies.</p>
      <p>Thus, if a player that has already resolved their <em>Critical Overflow 
      Bug</em> dies and is raised, <em>Critical Error</em> will give them a 
      fresh copy of <em>Critical Overflow Bug</em>, which just so happens to 
      resolve in 21 seconds, which is also when <em>Oversampled Wave Cannon</em> 
      resolves.</p>
