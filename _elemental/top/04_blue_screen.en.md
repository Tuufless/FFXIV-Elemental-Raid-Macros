# Blue Screen

After defeating Omega in the previous phase, Omega will "reboot", resetting
its HP to 100% and begin the phase.

This phase is a short, 55-second race to bring Omega's HP below 20% before
Omega's enrage (Blue Screen) goes off.

This is where groups will typically open with a melee LB3.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Limit Break priority</b></td>
    <td>NIN > DRG > MNK > VPR > RPR > SAM</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the meantime, the party will need to deal with simple stack/spread mechanics
while dodging the expanding donut AoEs from the earlier transition phase.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> The stack deals more damage than the spread.</p>
  <p>Mitigations that last 15-seconds are best used after the spread beams in
  order to cover two stacks.</p>
</div>

## Second Wave

The following sets of Wave Cannons now come with the expanding Wave Repeater
AoE from the center.

  </tr>
  <tr>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Limit Break]</b> What determines who should melee LB3 here?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The order is determined by who loses the least from doing so. This is
      obviously affected by Dance Partner, but as a general guideline, the
      order looks like:</p>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>NIN > DRG > MNK > RPR > SAM</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>NIN LBs here without any real loss- maybe a non-<em>Meisui</em> 
        <em>Bhavacakra</em> at most.</li>
        <li>DRG loses a <em>Wyrmwind Thrust</em>. Even if a NIN loses a <em>Bhavacakra</em>, that is still less than a lost <em>Wyrmwind Thrust</em> (-350 vs -420 potency).</li>
        <li>MNK loses two Opo-opo GCDs, resulting in a lost critical
        <em>Bootshine</em>, which can also lead to a lost <em>Forbidden
        Chakra</em>.</li>
        <li>
          <p>Neither RPR nor SAM wants to LB3 P4, because they can carry over
          a third <em>Enshroud</em>, or a <em>Meikyo Shisui</em> from P3.</p>
          <p>However, if forced to make a decision, a SAM's rotation is more
          rigid, causing them to lose a <em>Midare Setsugekka</em> and a
          <em>Shoha</em> if they LB3 in P4 (-1200 potency, not taking
          <em>Midare Setsugekka's</em> guaranteed crit into account).</p>
          <p>In contrast, a RPR's LB3 may cause them to overcap their Shroud
          Gauge as a result of the LB3 interfering with their rotation. This is
          admittedly awkward, but not as big of a loss compared to SAM, and can
          be avoided by spending an Enshroud at the end of P3 instead of carrying
          it over to P4.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Wave Cannon (stacks)]</b> Can a tank solo the stack? How much damage 
  would it deal?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The <em>Wave Cannon</em> stack deals approximately 210k damage to a
      tank taking it solo.</p>
      <p>This is actually rather tame compared to other tankbusters in the
      encounter, so <em>some</em> tanks will take the stack North and solo it
      instead with mitigation, provided the first <em>Solar Ray</em> in P5
      isn't mitigated (which should be the case for most party
      compositions).</p>
