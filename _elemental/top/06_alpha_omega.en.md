# Alpha Omega

## Mitigations

This phase requires planning out and coordinating mitigations. One such
mitigation plan is:

The above mitigation plan is a bare-bones framework that was made in the 
*absence* of jobs that provide more than one sort of mitigation such as PLD's 
*Passage of Arms*, AST's *Collective Unconsciousness*, MCH's *Dismantle*, or 
RDM's *Magick Barrier*.

It was also made in the *absence* of other healer mitigations, such as 
*Divine Benison*, *Aquaveil/Exaltation*, *Consolation/Panhaima* or *Fey 
Illumination*. While the above framework will still work without any of these 
abilities, healers should supplement the plan with these abilities for 
comfort.

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Note:</b> There is an edge case where you specifically have a PLD MT
  that used <em>Hallowed Ground</em> at the first <em>Solar Ray</em> in P5,
  paired with a GNB ST at used <em>Superbolide</em> on the second.</p>
  <p>In such a scenario, the two tanks will need to swap their invuln vs 
  mitigation for the two <em>Wave Cannons</em> (i.e: PLD MT invuln first).</p>
</div>

---

## Preparation

This phase has a number of things that need to be decided in advance. This is
usually either done at the start of the encounter, or during the cutscene
before the phase begins.

- Decide the Tank LB3 order.
- Decide the Melee LB3 order.
- Decide which healer will go middle for Cosmo Meteor. 

It's also recommended that both D3 and D4 prepare a Limit Break macro targeting
the player's target to avoid needing to aim/position the LB3 manually.
```
/macroicon "limit break"
/ac "limit break" <t>
```

---

## Cosmo Memory

*Cosmo Memory* is a Tank LB3 check- it also needs at least shields in addition
to the Tank LB3 for the party to survive.

As far as priorities go, the tank that LB3s should go:

WAR > PLD > DRK > GNB

This will also convert everyone with three stacks of *Quickening Dynamis* into
a stack of *Brilliant Dynamis*.

          <ul>
            <li><em>Brilliant Dynamis</em> turns to <em>Spark of Dynamis</em>.</li>
            <li>The limit break gauge refills based on the Limit Break level
            used (i.e: if LB2 was used, two Limit Break bars will be refilled).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Mitigates a large portion of damage from Omega.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>

    <td style="text-align:center">

      <ul>
        <li>Mitigates a large portion of damage from Omega.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Dynamis buffs are lost when a player dies, which will end up killing that
player for all of Alpha's Omega's mechanics thereafter.

---

## Auto-attacks

Before each mechanic combo starts, Alpha Omega will autoattack twice.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Alpha Omega's autoattack hit <b>two</b> players:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Whoever is holding aggro (the MT).</li>
        <li>The <em>furthest</em> player.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Ensure the ST is the furthest player taking the autoattacks by having
      them stand outside the targeting circle, while the party stays inside.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/06/alpha_omega_aa.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Note:</b> Alpha Omega's auto-attacks <em>ignore</em> tank invulns. Tanks
whose invuln leaves them at 1HP will need to be healed to survive incoming
auto-attacks.</div>

---

## Cosmo Arrow â†’ Cosmo Dive

Alpha Omega autoattacks twice before starting its first mechanic combination.

The first combination of mechanics is Alpha Omega's version of the BRD and DRG
LBs.

- *Cosmo Arrow* fires two sets of line AoEs that travel sideways with each hit.
  How the party dodges these is determined by which set of AoEs appeared first.
- *Cosmo Dive* targets the two closest players with a high-damage AoE (which  
  should be taken by the tanks), and the furthest player with a stack AoE (the
  rest of the party).

## Unlimited Wave Cannon â†’ Wave Cannon

Alpha Omega autoattacks twice before starting its second combination.

The next combination are two different Wave Cannons.

*Unlimited Wave Cannon* spawns four staggered "Exaflare" AoEs along an arc
outside the arena in combination to six (large) baited AoEs under each player.

This is resolved by stacking together in the middle of the arena, and observing
where the Exaflare arc begins. The party moves 1.5 waymarks (67 degrees) from
the first Exaflare- this Exaflare would have passed the party by the time they
reach its position, making movement simple.

*Wave Cannon* is the hard-hitting mechanic with this combination- the party
needs to spread for two sets of four beams before stacking together to share
one hard-hitting beam.

In particular, this final beam deals extra damage to the two front players,
which should be the tanks.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Four consecutive Exaflare AoE telegraphs will appear on the
      outside of the arena.</p>
      <p>The first Exaflare telegraph will appear just before the castbar
      finishes.</p>
      <p>Stack in the middle to bait AoEs, before moving out, 1.5 markers
      before the first Exaflare telegraph.</p>

      have passed and you should be just outside the boss's targeting circle.</p>
      <p>Turn and continue baiting AoEs in the same direction that the
      Exaflares spawned.</p>

## Cosmo Arrow â†’ Wave Cannon

Alpha Omega autoattacks twice before starting its third mechanic combination.

This *Cosmo Arrow* is *independent* to the first *Cosmo Arrow* at the start of
the phase- it will *not* necessarily be the "opposite" to the first.

The catch this time is the *Wave Cannon* in the middle, as the party will now
need to spread for the two sets of four beams while simultaneously dodging the 
*Cosmo Arrow*.

The final *Wave Cannon* stack resolves shortly after *Cosmo Arrow* finishes.

## Unlimited Wave Cannon â†’ Cosmo Dive

Alpha Omega autoattacks twice before starting its fourth mechanic combination.

This is probably the simplest of all four combinations- dodge *Unlimited Wave
Cannon* the same way as before, only this time, the party will stay where they
are after dodging the sixth baited AoE to share the *Cosmo Dive* stack.

The tanks will move forward into the boss's hitbox, with the MT going to the
left, and the ST to the right.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Just like before, four consecutive Exaflare AoE telegraphs
      will appear on the outside of the arena.</p>
      <p>The first Exaflare telegraph will appear just before the castbar
      finishes.</p>
      <p>Stack in the middle to bait AoEs, before moving out, 1.5 markers
      before the first Exaflare telegraph.</p>

      <p><b>2.</b> Stagger-step on your way out.</p>
      <p>By the time the third baited AoE appears, the first Exaflare would
      have passed and you should be just outside the boss's targeting circle.</p>
      <p>Turn and continue baiting AoEs in the same direction that the
      Exaflares spawned.</p>

  <tr>

        <li><b>MT</b>: Go forward and to the left.</li>

At this point, the party *should* have rebuilt LB3 from the start of the phase.

This is where the two melee DPS will take turns LB3'ing the boss before the
final major mechanic. The third melee LB3 doesn't happen until the enrage cast.

As a general rule, the DPS LB order goes something like the following, although
this **should be confirmed between the two melee** either at the start of the
encounter, or during the cutscene before P6.

*(Who does the final LB3 during the enrage cast will obviously be
different if either melee is partnered with a DNC.)*

## Cosmo Meteor

For this part, **one healer** will typically return to the middle to top up the
party as there are a number of waves of damage going out. **This is usually
confirmed between the two healers** either at the start of the encounter, or
during the cutscene before P6, but generally follows the following order:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Healer Mid priority</b></td>
    <td>AST > SGE/SCH > WHM</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Alpha Omega will autoattack twice before turning to face North and cast *Cosmo
Meteor*.

## Magic Number

From here, Alpha Omega will cast *Magic Number*, which *must* be mitigated with
a Tank LB3. *Magic Number* will also apply a debuff by the same name on all
members of the party, which must be dispelled with a Healer LB3.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/06/magic_number.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><em>Affected by a factor that Omega previously considered meaningless.
      This effect can be dispelled via healer limit break.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kills the player when the debuff timer (6s) expires.</li>
        <li>This debuff can only be removed via Healer LB3.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Alpha Omega will do a second *Magic Number* (requiring another Tank into Healer
LB3) before casting *Run: \*\*\*\*mi\** (which is a 30-second cast) as the hard
enrage of the fight.

The tanks and healers will typically follow a *"MT group" > "ST group"*
priority, although this is affected by whether a DRK is going to do the
"suicide strat" (see the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions)).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Tanks</b></td>
    <td>DRK > MT > ST</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Healers</b></td>
    <td>H1 > H2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that after the second healer LB3, the Limit Gauge will refill, giving one
final melee LB3 during the enrage cast.

---

## Buff windows

There are three buff windows in P6, and each player can use a potion once.

However, because players will be taking turns LB3'ing, some players will prefer
not to use their potions at certain buff windows.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>1. Opener</b>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>The tank that LB3s <b>should not</b> use potions here.</p>
      <p>If you did not use potions immediately at the end of Delta, they will
      not be available here.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

  <b>[Cosmo Memory]</b> Why is the tank LB3 priority WAR > PLD > DRK > GNB?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Which tank should LB3 is determined by who loses the least from doing
      so.</p>
      <p>Because a WAR's and a DRK's burst is based on stacks with a very
      lenient timer (Inner Release and Delirium), it is very flexible.</p>
      <p>WAR and DRK get to use their 1m cooldowns on time with the rest of the
      party and still get the full benefit of their cooldowns, losing only a
      couple of filler GCDs.</p>
      <p>In contrast, PLD and GNB have their bursts on a timer (Fight or Flight
      and No Mercy), and their rotation revolves around getting as many attacks
      in that buff window as they can.</p>
      <p>As a result, a PLD or GNB either has to desynchronise with the party
      raid buffs, or give up GCDs in their own window, neither of which are
      attractive choices.</p>

  <b>[Wave Cannon]</b> Why does the ST invuln first and not the MT?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is to accommodate for PLD + GNB tank compositions.</p>
      <p>If you happen to have a GNB (MT) + PLD (ST) for tanks, PLD must
      Hallowed Ground the first Solar Ray (before Delta) for them to get a
      Hallowed Ground use in P6.</p>
      <p>This then means the GNB would have to Superbolide the second Solar
      Ray (before Sigma), and if so, Superbolide won't be up in time for
      Wave Cannon #1.</p>

  <b>[Wave Cannon]</b> Why don't we debuff the boss during the spread beams?
  Wouldn't that eliminate the chance someone in the party misses out on
  mitigation since the party is spread out?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Debuffing the boss for <em>Wave Cannon's</em> spreads <em>would</em>
      ensure that the damage is lowered no matter where all players are.
      Unfortunately, it has some unwanted consequences.</p>
      <p>First, debuffs like <em>Addle</em>, <em>Dismantle</em>,
      <em>Feint</em>, and <em>Reprisal</em> each last 10 seconds, but there is
      only 9 seconds between the first set of <em>Wave Cannon's</em> spreads,
      to the final stack.</p>
      <p>If we are reliant on debuffs to survive all of <em>Wave Cannon</em>,
      then the first set of players may die if the debuff is too late, but the
      whole party dies if it is applied too early. Not assigning debuffs on
      <em>Wave Cannon</em>'s spreads eliminates this timing requirement.</p>
      <p>That isn't the only problem- by debuffing the boss during the spread
      beams, you risk not generating LB gauge, which leaves the party with an
      LB2 (instead of an LB3) at <em>Cosmo Dive</em> 2.</p>
      <p>The reason behind this is due to how LB is generated- LB is generated
      whenever someone survives damage that is equal to or greater than their
      current HP due to mitigation or shields.</p>
      <p>However, there is some fine print- the order of operations are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Apply debuffs to reduce outgoing damage <em>(Addle, Dismantle, 
        Feint, Reprisal)</em></li>
        <li><b>Generate LB if damage is equal to or greater than current HP</b></li>
        <li>Apply mitigations to reduce incoming damage <em>(Aquaveil,
        Kerachole, Sacred Soil, Third Eye,
        etc.)</em></li>
        <li>Absorb damage from shields <em>(Divine Veil, Shade Shift, Succor, 
        etc.)</em></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The problem is that if enough debuffs are on the boss at Step 1, the
      damage at Step 2 is <em>no longer lethal</em>, and thus, <em>LB is not
      generated.</em></p>
      <p>In <em>Wave Cannon's</em> case, the base damage of the initial beams
      is lethal, but <em>not by much</em>, and is thus particularly susceptible
      to being overmitigated this way.</p>
      <p>A single <em>Reprisal</em> already borders on making the spread beams
      not lethal. Adding a second debuff lowers the damage down to well within
      a player's max HP. This is no longer lethal damage, LB will not be
      generated as a result.</p>

  <b>[Wave Cannon]</b> Why are the invulns fixed to the roles, and not the
  jobs? Aren't the invulns in P5 determined by the jobs?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The invulns in P5 are fixed to the jobs because PLD must
      <em>Hallowed Ground</em> the first <em>Solar Ray</em> to even have a use
      in P6.</p>
      <p>However, the problem with fixing the invulns to jobs is when the
      standard MT/ST priority is not followed, for example, a PLD MT and WAR
      ST.</p>
      <p>In that scenario, if you fix the invulns to the jobs, but the
      mitigations to the roles, you open yourself to a wipe where the WAR has
      to <em>Vengeance</em> and <em>Bloodwhetting</em>, but also <em>Shake It
      Off</em>, which will dispel the WAR's buffs if used in the wrong order.</p>
      <p>You <em>can</em> get around this by then pinning the party mitigation
      to the jobs instead of the roles as well, but that becomes more trouble
      than it's worth.</p>
      <p>Given that it would be more common to have a WAR in the party (and
      thus a WAR ST) compared to specifically PLD MT + GNB ST, this is an
      acceptable tradeoff, with just a note to callout PLD MT + GNB ST
      as an exception.</p>

  <b>[Wave Cannon #2]</b> I see some WAR MTs use <em>Shake It Off</em> to mitigate
  <em>Wave Cannon #2's</em> spread instead of the stack. Similarly, some SCHs 
  use <em>Expedient</em> at <em>Cosmo Dive #1</em> and <em>Cosmo Meteor</em> 
  instead of mitigating <em>Wave Cannon #2</em>'s stack. Is there a problem?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Some WARs will <em>Shake It Off</em> immediately after <em>Wave 
      Cannon #1's</em> stack, which lasts long enough to mitigate <em>Wave 
      Cannon #2's</em> spread. This lets them get an additional use of 
      <em>Shake It Off</em> at <em>Cosmo Meteor's</em> Flares.</p>
      <p>In a similar vein, some SCHs prefer to use <em>Expedient</em> like 
      H1's 120s, mitigating <em>Cosmo Dive #1</em> and <em>Cosmo Meteor</em>. 
      Instead of <em>Expedient</em>, SCHs will use <em>Fey Illumination</em> 
      to mitigate <em>Wave Cannon #2's</em> stack.</p>
      <p>Strictly speaking, there's nothing wrong with any of this 
      <em>provided the party survives Wave Cannon #2's stack.</em></p>
      <p>However, problems may arise when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The WAR uses <em>Shake It Off</em> to mitigate the spread damage,
        but lacks the contextual understanding that it's a SCH's <em>Fey 
        Illumination</em> that makes up for it and does so in a party with a 
        SGE H2.</li>
        <li>Both the WAR <em>and</em> the SCH independently move their 
        assigned mitigations off <em>Wave Cannon #2's stack</em>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unfortunately, WAR is very popular in TOP because of how 
      <em>Holmgang</em> simplifies the <em>Solar Ray</em> tankbusters in P5,
      and SCH is very strong at mitigating P6, so this particular combination
      (and thus scenario) is not uncommon.</p>
      <p>This is the reason why a <em>Feint</em> has been added to <em>Wave 
      Cannon #2's</em> mitigation as insurance against this happening.
      The SCH may also need to add <em>Dissipation</em> to the mix to ensure 
      the party survives a high-roll.</p>
      <p>On the plus side, the WAR using <em>Shake It Off</em> at <em>Cosmo 
      Meteor's</em> Flares mean that <em>Feint</em> will not be needed 
      there.</p>

  <b>[Cosmo Meteor]</b> Why is the healer priorty AST > SGE/SCH > WHM for who

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>At the end of the day, we want the party to be topped up between waves
      of Meteors, with shields. Note that H1 is also using their 120s
      mitigation there <em>(Temperance/Neutral Sect)</em>.</p>
      <p>An AST with <em>Neutral Sect</em> not only has the strongest healing,
      but also the strongest shields. Putting the AST in the center assures all
      party members can get <em>Macrocosmos</em>, which is a great way to top
      up the party after <em>Cosmo Meteor</em>.</p>
      <p>Both SGE and SCH are largely interchangeable since they both can apply
      shields. That being said, SGE would have the better pure-healing ability
      because of <em>Pneuma</em>.</p>
      <p>WHM is last because they cannot apply shields. Furthermore,
      <em>Temperance</em> covers the entire arena, and WHM can place and
      trigger <em>Liturgy of the Bell</em> in the center to top up and mitigate
      damage for the party without needing to be in the center themselves.</p>

      <p>Yes, it would, and <em>Dark Missionary</em> or <em>Heart of Light</em>

      <em>Sacred Soil/Kerachole</em>, the H2 30s mitigation may not be 
      available to catch the first wave of four Meteor hits- this is where
      the ST 90s mitigations come in to make up for this first wave of Meteors 
      while the H2 30s come back off cooldown, even if it's just a shield from
