<b>Tip:</b> If tanks use Rampart at the end of the previous phase (when Omega
jumps away), Rampart will cover this <em>Solar Ray</em> and be back up in time
for the tethers in <em>Limitless Synergy</em>.

After a while, Omega-M and Omega-F will both cast *Party Synergy*, the first
major mechanic of this phase.

## Party Synergy

All players in the party will be tethered together and paired, indicated by
the Playstation symbols. The party will also get either *Mid Glitch*, or
*Remote Glitch*.

Omega-M/F's AoEs are determined by the weapons held by the genuine Omega-M/F
pair. Note how the markers demarcate the boundary of Omega-F's AoE.

*Party Synergy* is one of the hardest mechanics in the game, and will take
*considerable* practice. Nukemaru has compiled a collection of clips which may
help:

After dodging Omega-M/F's AoEs, the party now resolves *Mid/Remote Glitch*.

      <ul>
        <li>The left-side group will always knockback to the west.</li>

</table>

Because Omega-M and Omega-F swapped genders during *Party Synergy*, the tank
who previously had hate on Omega-M will now have hate on Omega-F, and 
vice-versa. Both tanks will need to *Provoke* their target either before 
*Party Synergy*, or immediately after as the *Packet Filter* debuff is still 
on.

After a few autoattacks, the two clones will cast *Limitless Synergy*, dropping
the *Packet Filter* debuffs, and giving the party one GCD to hit both targets
before starting *Limitless Synergy*.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> Omega-M will briefly stop auto-attacking to cast <em>Synthetic
  Shield</em> to prepare for <em>Limitless Synergy</em>.</p>
  <p>As a result, the ST (who is holding Omega-F) will take more damage during
  this interim from Omega-F's auto-attacks.</p>
  <p>This is also a good place to use <em>Addle</em>, as Omega-F's auto-attacks
  are magical, and targeted debuffs will not be used during <em>Limitless 
  Synergy</em>.</p>
</div>

## Limitless Synergy

Omega-F will teleport North and begin casting *Laser Shower*. Omega-M will 
teleport to the middle of the arena and shield Omega-F, rendering her 
invulnerable until Omega-M is defeated.

Meanwhile, five more Omega-M/F clones outside the arena will throw various
mechanics at the party to resolve.

      that was hit with <em>Beyond Defense</em>) together with <em>Optimised 
      Meteor</em>.</p>
      <p>This will need to be <em>heavily</em> mitigated.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/02/limitless_synergy_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

After *Pile Pitch* resolves, the eye will cast *Cosmo Memory*, another 
raid-wide. Because *Cosmo Memory* is cast by the untargetable Optical Unit,
this damage cannot be mitigated by targeted debuffs *(Addle, Dismantle, Feint,
Reprisal)*.

With no other mechanics left in the phase, the party must defeat Omega-M,
followed by Omega-F (in that order) before Omega-F's *Laser Shower* resolves as
the hard enrage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<summary>
  <b>[Firewall]</b> Should I apply DoTs on the other target before Firewall
  resolves?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>No. The Firewall effectively only lets you damage either Omega-M
      <em>or</em> Omega-F, but not both (even certain abilities like Reprisal
      are blocked).</p>
      <p>If you apply a DoT on the other target before Firewall resolves, it
      will technically tick, but deals 0 damage.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Limitless Synergy]</b> How far should the tethers be stretched to
  maximise the width of the safe corridor?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Short answer: the tanks should aim to stretch the tethers <b>five tick 
      marks</b> from the clones.</p>
      <p>Long answer: We want to point the conal cleaves as far outwards as we
      can without going outside the arena. In other words, we want the tether
      to be tangent to the arena's circumference, creating a right-angled
      triangle with the center of the arena, and where the clones spawn.</p>
      <p>From there:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The arena has a radius of 20 yalms.</li>
        <li>The clones spawn 22 yalms away from the center (outside the arena).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trigonometry then gets us cos(θ) = 20/22, so θ = 24.62 degrees.</p>
      <p>Each tick mark on the outside of the arena corresponds to 5 degrees,
      so we want the tanks to pull the tethers <b>5 tick marks</b> to maximise 
      the safe zone for the party to dodge to (particularly helpful for
      "cursed" patterns).</p>
      <p>Done correctly, there should still be some space between Omega-M's 
      targeting circle, and the cleaves.</p>
