# Omega

Omega's first form is often nicknamed "Beetle Omega", and is one of the many
iterations of Omega players will encounter this Ultimate raid.

---

## Program Loop

Players receive a set of numbered debuffs. Each number (1, 2, 3, and 4) each
have two players.

- The **numbered** debuffs incidate the order players need to take **towers**
  (1 > 2 > 3 > 4).
- **Tethers** are resolved two steps away from the towers (3 > 4 > 1 > 2)

When tethers resolve, they explode in a large AoE, applying one stack of
Twice-come Ruin and a HP Penalty debuff that reduces that player's maximum HP
to 1%.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>There are eight possible tower spawn points.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Two towers will always spawn at a time, and they will always be either
        90 degrees, or 180 degrees from one another.</li>
        <li>Towers will not spawn in the same position twice in a row.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We establish a priority to determine who takes which tower/tether:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>CW from NW:</b> H1 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 H2</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/01/program_loop_setup.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The *HP Penalty* debuff will wear off within two steps (this means players
numbered 3 and 4 will need healing to survive their towers).

      numbered debuff.</p>

## Pantokrator

We decided to go with **HaruGlory's** Pantokrator strat, which puts the beam at
the back, and the missile in front.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Face Omega North.</p>
      <p>The rest of the party can stay near the center of the arena, ready to
      adjust if needed.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/01/pantokrator_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> The party will be numbered again in pairs of 1-4.</p>
      <p>Split the party into two groups, one referencing NW, and the other
      referencing SE:</p>
      <p>We need to split the party into two groups of four such that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each group has one of each number.</li>
        <li>Each group has one healer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To do so, we use the following priority order:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>NW:</b> H1 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 H2 <b>:SE</b></li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/01/pantokrator_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The first set of Flamethrower telegraphs will appear. If the Flamethrowers hit
the NW and SE points, rotate **clockwise** to the next safe sector.

These will be your starting sectors.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      In these examples, the first <em>Flamethrower</em> <b>does not hit</b> NW/SE,
      so those are the starting positions for each group.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      In these examples, the first <em>Flamethrower</em> <b>hits</b> NW/SE, so each
      group rotates clockwise until they reach a safe area.

  </tr>

  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The movement for Pantokrator goes like this. Each light-party
      <b>stagger-steps</b> forward, while the next player to bait the missile
      breaks away from the party.</p>
      <p>The next missile player's movement looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Wave Cannon hits.</li>
        <li>Everybody moves forward for one AoE.</li>
        <li>Drop the next AoE in the center.</li>
        <li>Drop the next AoE in the front (the next round of beams +
        missiles resolves here).</li>
        <li>Drop the next AoE back and <b>out</b>.</li>
        <li>Rejoin the party. You have one extra AoE to do so before the next
        beam + missile resolves.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/01/pantokrator_movement.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Put together, it will look something like this:

The loop repeats two more times (with players numbered 3 and 4 taking their
turns to leave the stack to bait missiles).

### Wave Cannons

Omega will target the two **furthest** players for 120-degree tankbuster
cleaves (Diffuse Wave Cannon Kyrios). These should be taken by the tanks.

Omega will then target the three random non-tank players with a red marker for
Wave Cannon Kyrios.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>16.</b> Both tanks stack north, <b>outside</b> Omega's targeting
      circle.</p>
      <p>This gives enough space for the rest of the party spreads around the
      south half of the arena <b>inside</b> of Omega's targeting circle.</p>
      <p>Three random (non-tank) players will be selected for the first set of
      Wave Cannons.</p>
      <p>The marks will pulse five times before the mechanic resolves. Both
      tanks should use their invulns on the fifth pulse.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Program Loop]</b> Why do some tanks face Omega 45 degrees off (towards an
  intercardinal)?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This allows the melee DPS to get both rear and flank positionals from
      half the possible tower positions.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Pantokrator]</b> Why does the party group up NW and SE instead of N and S?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>This is done because the Flamethrowers are based on Omega's
      orientation.</p>
      <p>The problem with facing Omega directly at the party (if they were to
      start N/S) is that the Flamethrowers are 60-degree cones that move in
      multiples of 30 degrees.</p>
      <p>This means that you can have a scenario like the following, where it's
      now ambiguous whether the N/S parties count as getting hit.</p>
      <p>This is especially problematic when the agreed movement is "always
      rotate clockwise to the safe sector", which is clearly not ideal in this
      scenario.</p>
      <p>By pointing Omega at a 45 degree angle from the two assigned points,
      you guarantee that Omega's Flamethrower will <em>never</em> end up in
      this scenario, removing said ambiguity altogether.</p>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Pantokrator]</b> Why do we resolve the stack at the back instead of the
  front?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are a few advantages to stacking at the back:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only the first pair of missile players really need to pay attention
        to which way the Flamethrowers rotate at the beginning.</li>
        <li>With only one person in front of the party, there is much less
        variation from run-to-run as there is only one AoE to potentially
        dodge.</li>
        <li>The first set of AoEs can be baited inside the Flamethrower, giving
        the party more room to work with.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, putting the stack in front (missile at the back) has the
      following disadvantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The missile player at the back is potentially blocked by
        <em>three</em> player's AoEs and it's much easier to accidentally box
        them in, leaving them with nowhere to go.</li>
        <li>Furthermore, when something <em>does</em> go wrong, it is much
        harder to diagnose what the root problem is, as things often look okay
        from one player's perspective, but has trickle-down consequences for
        other players.</li>

## Troubleshooting

<summary>
  <b>[Program Loop]</b> I keep forgetting if it's my turn to do something!
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>You will always alternate between "doing nothing" and "doing
      something" (taking a tower or taking a tether).</p>
      <p>If it's your second time to "do something", and you've forgotten
      whether it's your turn to take a tower or tether, you can look at your
      numbered debuff. <b>If your numbered debuff is still there, it's your
      turn to take a tower.</b></p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can also use your HP as a reminder:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your HP is <b>high</b>: You took a tower earlier, so it's now
        your turn to take a <b>tether</b>.</li>
        <li>If your HP is <b>low</b>: You took a tether earlier, and your
        <em>HP Penalty</em> just wore off. It's now your turn to take a
        <b>tower</b>.</li>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Pantokrator]</b> Why does someone keep getting an AoE dropped in front of
  them?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Check that all players move the same way.</p>
      <p>There are actually <em>two</em> ways to drop AoEs during Pantokrator.</p>
      <p>We have the next missile player stay with the group for one more AoE
      after the Wave Cannon, before breaking away to the front (the yellow
      path).</p>
      <p>There is a faster path that Haru Glory used at the beginning of their
      prog that has the next missile player break away immediately when the
      Wave Cannon hits (the green path).</p>
      <p>There will be a problem when one player does the slow, yellow path,
      and the next player does the faster, green path. The front player's AoEs
      won't have gone off by the time the next player wants to move into that
      spot.</p>
      <p>Haru Glory's group also swapped to the slower path later on.</p>
