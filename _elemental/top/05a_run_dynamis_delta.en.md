# Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

P5 is split up into three "trios"- Delta, Sigma, and Omega. Each trio involves
a series of mechanics before ending with Hello, World debuffs that give players
stacks of Dynamis, needed to clear the final phase.

The strat that PF uses is the "Kinda Awk" strat, that pairs like tethers
together.

---

## Hello, World

The Hello, World debuffs serve as the "big puzzle" over the course of Delta,
Sigma, and Omega. There are a total of four sets of Hello, World debuffs that
the party will need to manage, and the goal is to **have each player enter
the final phase with 3 stacks of Dynamis**.

## Solar Ray

There are four Solar Rays in this phase. These are two-hit tankbusters that
also apply Magic Vulnerability, forcing either a tank swap, or invuln.

They also hit *extremely* hard (base damage is a little under *three times*
a tank's max HP).

Two of these will be taken with invulnerabilities, and the other two with
mitigations; however, which two will depend on your party composition.

      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>

Note that the invuln/mitigation order is determined by the tank *jobs*, and
not by the tank *roles*.

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Note:</b> There is an edge case where you specifically have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>WAR + PLD tanks <em>and</em></li>
    <li>Fast killtimes <em>(Hallowed Ground not available for first Solar Ray)</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In such a scenario, use <em>Holmgang</em> for the second <em>Solar Ray</em>,
  essentially falling back to the "no WAR" plan. WARs, however, may not be
  familiar with this fallback.</p>
</div>

After the Solar Ray, Omega-M will cast *Run: \*\*\*\*mi\* (Delta Version)*,
which is a *very* hard-hitting raid-wide.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> There is ~1:22 between Run Dynamis (Delta Version) and Run:
  Dynamis (Sigma Version).</p>
  <p>Party mitigations that last 15 seconds, and have a 90-second cooldown (tank
  mitigations, D3) can be used immediately after the second Solar Ray hit in
  order to catch Run Dynamis (Delta Version) <em>and</em> be back up in time for
  Run Dynamis (Sigma Version).</p>
  <p>Healer party mitigations last 20 seconds, and can be used to mitigate both
  Solar Ray hits <em>and</em> the follow-up Run Dynamis if timed correctly.</p>

## Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)

Run: Dynamis (Delta Version) can be broken down into three parts:

1. [Rocket Punches](#1-rocket-punches)
2. [Oversampled Wave Cannon and Pile Pitch](#2-oversampled-wave-cannon-and-pile-pitch)
3. [Hello, World](#3-hello-world)

## 1. Rocket Punches

Tethers appear, splitting the party up into two groups:

- Four players will have red/green tethers.
- The other four players will have blue tethers.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will also appear on two players
    with a blue tether.

          one long, and one short.</p>
          <p>The "long" tether should be long enough to immediately break once
          the tethers are activated.</p>

        partner.</li>

      together, so the inner tether (H2 and D2) swap sides. There is no swap

      their fist partners (H1 and D4 respectively).</em></p>

## 2. Oversampled Wave Cannon and Pile Pitch

After baiting the outside arm lasers, players are split into two groups based
on their tethers, with each tether group having different responsibilities.

- Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.

<table>

      monitors in the other direction of Final Omega's Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p>
      <p>This creates a safe corridor for the three blue-tethered players that
      weren't hit by Beyond Defense to stack together to share Pile Pitch.</p>
      <p>Note that the Pile Pitch stack may or may not include the player with
      Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading.</p>
      <p>The player hit by Beyond Defense stands somewhere within this
      corridor, away from the Pile Pitch stack.</p>

## 3. Hello, World

Omega-M and Final Omega will disappear, which is the cue for the last part of
the mechanic, and where players will finally resolve Hello, Near World and
Hello, Distant World.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<table>
  <tr>

<summary>
  <b>[Solar Ray]</b> If we don't have a WAR, why don't we alternate between
  invulning and mitigating <em>Solar Ray</em>? Wouldn't that be easier?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is a tradeoff to prepare for P6.</p>
      <p>You <em>can</em> alternate between invulning and mitigating Solar Rays
      in P5, but doing so leads to problems later on in P6.</p>
      <p>First, only two tanks can invuln the Solar Ray before Run: Dynamis
      (Omega) and have their invuln back in P6- DRK and WAR, so if your party
      is PLD + GNB, you're out of luck and have to invuln the first two Solar
      Rays in P5 to invuln anything in P6.</p>
      <p>This means we are left with DRK + (PLD/GNB), and we have to make a
      choice whether the Living Dead the second Solar Ray (before Sigma), or
      the third Solar Ray (before Omega).</p>
      <p>If a DRK spends Living Dead on the third Solar Ray, Living Dead will
      only be available for the final tankbuster in P6, leading to the
      following base mitigation plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[~0:00] Cosmo Dive #1 → Rampart</li>
        <li>[~0:46] Wave Cannon #1 → Shadow Wall</li>
        <li>[~1:20] Wave Cannon #2 → Rampart</li>
        <li>[~1:54] Cosmo Dive #2 → Living Dead</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This, however, has the following problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cosmo Dive has a high roll of about 280k base damage. In comparison,
        Wave Cannon hits much harder, with a high roll of 370k base damage
        <em>(that is not a typo!)</em>. As a result, additional resources will
        need to be dedicated to the DRK taking Wave Cannon with Rampart.</li>
        <li>Rampart will not be naturally off cooldown between Cosmo Dive #1 and
        Wave Cannon #2. The DRK will need to time the first Rampart so that it
        catches the Cosmo Dive at the end just so Rampart will be back up in time
        for Wave Cannon #2.</li>
        <li>The party is actively scrambling to coordinate party mitigation so that
        the party does not die to damage, yet alone give the DRK more mitigation to
        survive Wave Cannon #2 with Rampart. It's easier to move that fuss to P5's
        Solar Rays when there's less going on, and it's easier for the healers to
        pay more attention to the tanks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By not alternating between invulning and mitigating Solar Rays in P5, you
      get to do a much simpler base mitigation plan in P6 where things are more
      hectic:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[~0:00] Cosmo Dive #1 → Rampart</li>
        <li>[~0:46] Wave Cannon #1 → ST invuln, MT 30%</li>
        <li>[~1:20] Wave Cannon #2 → MT invuln, ST 30%</li>
        <li>[~1:54] Cosmo Dive #2 → Rampart</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This doesn't apply if your party has a WAR, as WAR is the <em>only</em>
      tank that can invuln the Solar Ray before Run: Dynamis (Omega) and have it
      back up for a Wave Cannon.</p>
