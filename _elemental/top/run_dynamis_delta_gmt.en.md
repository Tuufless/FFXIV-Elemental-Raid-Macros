# Appendix B: Run Dynamis (Delta Version) - GMT variant

This is an alternate method to resolving *Run: Dynamis (Delta Version)* that I
personally prefer, although it is not done in PF. That being said, I still
think it's a better strat for statics.

This strat differs from the "Kinda Awk" strat by pairing one green tether with
one blue tether together.

1. [Rocket Punches](#1-rocket-punches)
2. [Oversampled Wave Cannon and Pile Pitch](#2-oversampled-wave-cannon-and-pile-pitch)
3. [Hello, World](#3-hello-world)

Note that this strat is *not* strictly superior to Awk- it has different
failure conditions, although I think statics would get through Delta quicker
and more consistently with this strat compared to Awk.

### Clips

Here are some clips of this strat in action:

- [Long-blue, no swap](https://clips.twitch.tv/BlueShortWatermelonPraiseIt-7lLWiJgZ-bqR0S5w)
- [Long-blue, swap](https://clips.twitch.tv/FancyAggressiveWatermelonBIRB-lv-YD4rG2p5uZoFV)
- [Short-blue, no swap](https://clips.twitch.tv/TiredEnthusiasticElkUncleNox-uGMSen2jj0xstbQ7)
- [Green, swap](https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralPreciousClipzChocolateRain-TV_FvUvOzvYa-FyP)

## 1. Rocket Punches

Tethers appear, splitting the party up into two groups:

- Four players will have red/green tethers.
- The other four players will have blue tethers.
  - Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World will also appear on two players
    with a blue tether.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> When the tethers appear, make a box in the center with the
      blue tethers alongside the bosses, and the red/green tethers making the
      sides.</p>
      <p>Each corner should have a pair consisting of one player with a
      red/green tether, and one player with a blue tether.</p>
      <p>All players face <b>inwards</b> to make the fists tidy and easy to
      identify <em>(everyone on the top row faces down, everyone on the bottom
      row faces up.)</em></p>
      <p><em>In this example, the corner pairs are MT+D3, ST+H1, D1+H2, and
      D2+D4</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This is the part that distinguishes this strat from Awk:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan=2>
      <p><b>2.</b> Blue and yellow fists appear above each player.</p>
      <p>Players need to adjust as needed to pair one blue fist with one yellow
      fist, and the party needs to determine which colour tethers are the ones
      adjusting.</p>
      <p>Between the two red/green tethers and the two blue tethers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One set of tethers will have fists of the same colour (blue + blue,
        and yellow + yellow).</li>
        <li>The other set of tethers will each have one blue fist and one yellow
        fist.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>The tethers with the blue + yellow fists will be the ones
      adjusting.</b></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" style="text-align:center">
      <b>Red/green tethers adjust</b>
    </td>
    <td style="text-align:center">

  </tr>

      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_02b.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>In this example, the red/green tethers have the blue + yellow fists,
      so the red/green tethers will adjust if needed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MT and D1's corners each have one blue and one yellow fist, so they
        do not need to swap.</li>
        <li>H1 and D4's corners have two blue fists and two yellow fists, so
        <b>H1 and D4 will swap positions</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>In this example, the blue tethers have the blue + yellow fists,
      so the blue tethers will adjust if needed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>D3 and ST's corners each have one blue and one yellow fist, so they
        do not need to swap.</li>
        <li>H2 and D2's corners have two blue fists and two yellow fists, so
        <b>H2 and D2 will swap positions</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

At this point, most of the work is done, and the rest of the mechanic resolves
fairly naturally.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>3.</b> Split off and form a trapezium, with the long side at
      Beetle Omega, and the short side at Final Omega.</p>
    </td>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>4.</b> The spinning arms appear around the arena.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_04.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>5.</b> The tethers will activate, immediately breaking the long
      blue tether (do not move!)</p>
      <p>Wait for the fist AoEs to appear before splitting off (stretch your
      tethers).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Red/green tethers:</b> Bait the spinning arms by the two bosses.</li>
        <li><b>Long blue tethers:</b> Bait the middle spinning arms.</li>
        <li><b>Short blue tethers:</b> Break your tether and move center to
        bait <em>Beyond Defense</em>.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_05.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 2. Oversampled Wave Cannon and Pile Pitch

After baiting the outside arm lasers, players are split into two groups based
on their tethers, with each tether group having different responsibilities.

- Red/green tethered players will be **taking monitor hits**.
- Blue tethered players will be handling **Pile Pitch**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>6.</b> The outer arms will telegraph their AoEs targeting the
      closest player.</p>
      <p>The Omega-M clone hits one of the two closest players with Beyond
      Defense.</p></td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_06.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>7.</b> The player with Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading points their
      monitors in the other direction of Final Omega's Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p>
      <p>This creates a safe corridor for the three blue-tethered players that
      weren't hit by Beyond Defense to stack together to share Pile Pitch.</p>
      <p>Note that the Pile Pitch stack may or may not include the player with
      Oversampled Wave Cannon Loading.</p>
      <p>The player hit by Beyond Defense stands somewhere within this
      corridor, away from the Pile Pitch stack.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. Hello, World

This is the last part of the mechanic, and is where players will finally
resolve Hello, Near World and Hello, Distant World.

We decided to follow Kinda Awk's spread positions, which doesn't *quite* fit
the strat, but it's only a minor adjustment.

Also of note, we flipped the red/green tether roles- we let the red/green
tether on the safe side of Omega stay where they are, and let the other
pair break (this is reversed in Sfia's GMT group).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>8.</b> The "beetle" Omega lights up to cleave one side of the
      arena. Move in to the safe side.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>The green-tether pair on Beetle Omega's safe side</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>Position to receive Hello, Distant World:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The player towards Beetle Omega stands <b>on Beetle Omega</b>.</li>
        <li>The player away from Beetle Omega goes to the intercardinal mark away
        from Beetle Omega, and three more notches <b>away</b>.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>The green-tether pair on Beetle Omega's unsafe side</b></td>
    <td>
      <ol>
        <li>Break the tether when the <b>tether's debuff timer reaches 15
        seconds</b>.</li>
        <li>Position to receive Hello, Near World:
          <ul>
            <li>The player towards Beetle Omega goes to the <b>edge</b>, at the
            intercardinal position <b>towards</b> Beetle Omega.</li>
            <li>The player away from Beetle Omega goes to the <b>marker</b> at
            the intercardinal position.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Hello, Near World</b></td>
    <td>Stand <b>three rings from the center</b> along the cardinal between
    the two bosses.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Hello, Distant World</b></td>
    <td>Stand at the <b>edge</b> along the cardinal between the two bosses.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>The two remaining blue-tethers with no debuff</b></td>
    <td>Go to the <b>edge</b> of the arena at the intercardinal mark away from
    Beetle Omega, and three notches <b>towards</b> Beetle Omega- you will
    <em>not</em> be getting Dynamis stacks this round.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_08.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

With everyone in position, the cleave resolves together with Hello, Near World
and Hello, Distant World.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>9.</b> Break the final red/green tether when the <b>tether's debuff
      timer reaches 2 seconds</b>.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/B/run_dynamis_delta_gmt_09.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Delta]</b> Although PF does Kinda Awk, my static switched from
  Kinda Awk to GMT. Why?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>I had originally started with Kinda Awk's strat because at a first
      glance, it looked simple and easy to execute. In addition, PF over in
      Mana had started adopting Sara-chan's strat, which does the same thing in
      principle (except Sara-chan breaks the first blue tether <em>after</em>
      baiting fists, instead of before).</p>
      <p>I also didn't fully understand GMT's strat at the time (I wasn't aware
      that the fists spawn in BB/YY and BY/BY combinations), and so I decided
      not to go with GMT when I couldn't figure out how to resolve a
      theoretical "worst-case" configuration that will never actually happen
      in-game.</p>
      <p>However, when my group <em>actually</em> got to progging Delta with
      Awk, we kept wiping, particularly on the blue-tether side.</p>
      <p>Common complaints with Kinda Awk's strat were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There isn't <em>that</em> much time (one second) between when the
        first blue tether breaks, and when players have to stack together.</li>
        <li>The fists were generally in the way, so it was hard to see the
        AoEs on the ground.</li>
        <li>People were forgetting if they were the inner or outer pair after
        stacking together.</li>
        <li>We were taking turns wiping the party as members got blue tethers
        for the first time, despite reviewing what happened as a group.</li>
        <li>
          <p>There is an implicit distance between the four blue-tethered
          players:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The inner pair needs to be short enough so that they
            <em>do not</em> break.</li>
            <li>The outer pair must be far enough that they break
            immediately...</li>
            <li>...but not so far that they cannot move to stack on the inner
            pair in time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Groups have been using Beetle Omega's legs as a guide for the long
          blue-tether to help with this.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Delta was <em>still</em> inconsistent even after 10-12 pulls, so we
      swapped strats. After simulating GMT, we went back and cleared Delta the
      second time we saw it, and we have never wiped to Unmitigated Rocket
      Punch since.</p>
      <p>The main benefits of GMT are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It shares one advantage Awk has over Sara-chan by breaking the
        first blue tether immediately.</li>
        <li>Fists are baited in the middle of the arena (where the eye beam
        hits), which are <b>completely</b> out of the way.</li>
        <li>You have <b>much</b> more time to resolve fists.</li>
        <li>It's harder to confuse your roles since GMT's pairs are one
        red/green and one blue tether- your tether points in the direction
        you're supposed to go to next after the fist AoEs appear.</li>
        <li>All players move together with the same cues, regardless of their
        tether. This is important as this far into the fight, we want to
        eliminate as many special cases as we can to avoid players taking turns
        wiping the party to "the first time they get X".</li>
        <li>Players are reacting to one less thing (the blue tether breaking),
        since you start off stacked in pairs.</li>
        <li>There is <em>no</em> chance you accidentally break a green tether
        if the spinning fists force you to bait inwards.</li>
        <li>Resolving the green tethers for Swivel Cannon/Hello, World feels
        very natural since one green tether pair is <em>already</em> on Beetle
        Omega's safe side.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Perhaps we hadn't given Awk a fair chance before switching strats, or
      that the issues pointed above can be mitigated by looking at castbars,
      debuff timers, more practice, etc. and are non-issues <em>once familiar
      with the strat</em>.</p>
      <p>However, watching other groups prog and run into the same issues we
      had, I am convinced that GMT's strat is by far the better way to handle
      this mechanic.</p>
