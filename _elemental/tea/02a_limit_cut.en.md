# Limit Cut

While not technically a phase, the transition to Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser
is not trivial, and is probably the only transition in all the Ultimate fights
that takes up actual prog time.

In the transition leading up to Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser, players will
have to resolve *Limit Cut* in combination with a pair of *Hawk Blaster* AoEs
that go clockwise around the arena.

There are two main strats for Limit Cut- [1211](#1211), and [1256](#1256).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Limit Cut is a mechanic from A11S where all players get numbered from 
      1 to 8. The following then happens:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cruise Chaser <b>spawns behind</b> the first player (which will be
        an odd number) based on where that player is facing.</li>
        <li>Cruise Chaser cleaves the first player in a cone AoE.</li>
        <li>Cruise Chaser dashes at the next player (which will be an even 
        number) in a line AoE.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This process repeats (cleave odd, dash even) until all eight numbers 
      have been resolved. If a number is missing, Cruise Chaser picks a random
      target instead.</p>
      <p>Getting hit by Cruise Chaser will give you a <em>Magic Vulnerability</em>
      debuff, so you cannot get hit a second time.</p>
      <p>In addition, <b>you will be knocked away from Cruise Chaser if you are
      not facing Cruise Chaser when it hits you.</b></p>
      <p>Because Cruise Chaser always spawns behind the odd-numbered players,
      the odd-numbered players will <em>always</em> be knocked forward, unless
      nullified with <em>Arm's Length</em> or <em>Surecast</em>.</p>

## 1211

1211 is the strat highlighted by the [Korean simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdo02A5GbNPA9B4HN-NOt-vnTPyv2elH/view).

**Unlike the Korean simulator**, we recommend that both the odd and even
players point Cruise Chaser outside, and forward/backward at diagonals.

*(The simulator points Cruise Chaser directly outwards, and directly inwards
through the center of the arena).*

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>The name "1211" comes from the explosion intervals before each pair of
      players resolve Cruise Chaser's <em>Alpha Sword + Super Blassty Charge</em>
      combo.</p>

## 1256

1256 is personally my preferred method of resolving Limit Cut as I find it more
fluid and doesn't require players to face outside, or use anti-knockback
abilities. The 1256 vs. 3478 split also mirrors how Limit Cut will be resolved
later in [Wormhole Formation](../en/03_alex_prime.md#wormhole-formation).

However, it is the harder of the two to learn, especially for players new to
TEA.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>The name "1256" comes from the player numbers in each group.</p>
      <p>Players <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> start from the
      northern (west) explosion, while players <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>7</b>,
      and <b>8</b> start from the southern (east) explosion.</p>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/02a/limit_cut_1256_overview.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

To summarize the movement:

- The first set of Limit Cuts will be resolved at the **3rd and 4th**
  explosion.
- The second set of Limit Cuts will be resolved at the **7th and 8th**
  explosion.

After each group resolves their first Limit Cut, the pair on the outside (that
will resolve their Limit Cut next) and the pair on the inside (that just
finished resolving their Limit Cut) swaps places.
