# Perfect Alexander

The MT will take hate to start this phase.

---

## Forced March

This is the "tutorial" section of Perfect Alex, where *Ordained Stillness*, 
*Ordained Motion*, and the Light/Dark mechanics are introduced.

This section can be blocked out as follows:

1. Ordained Stillness/Motion
2. Forced March
3. Ordained Motion/Stillness *(whichever was not done before)*
4. Stack/Spread
5. Spread/Stack *(whichever was not done before)*

Perfect Alex will open the fight with *The Final Word*, which splits the party 
into two teams- Light, and Dark.

Dark players need to pay attention to who the Dark Beacon is as they need to 
stay close to that player (so they don't stray too far), and on the correct 
side (so they don't get marched into the wall).
</details>
</div>

While the Forced March timers tick down, Perfect Alexander will then cast 
*either* *Ordained Stillness* or *Ordained Motion*.

<table>

<b>RESPECT STILLNESS</b>. It is a meme for a reason.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b>: If you are unable to make it all the way to your position and 
<em>Ordained Stillness</em> is cast first, <b>resolve Stillness first</b>. 
There will be a little bit of time before the Forced March starts for you to 
finish getting into position.</div>

After the Forced March, Perfect Alexander will then use the opposite *Ordained 
Stillness* or *Ordained Motion*, whichever was not done first.

Then, Perfect Alexander will then do two simple stack vs. spread mechanics in a
random order.

  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Two <b>random</b> players will be targeted with a stack marker.</p>

      </ul>
      <p><em>(N.B: These are <b>not</b> Light vs. Dark stacks.)</em></p>
      <p>If a group has two stack markers, only <em>one</em> moves to the 
      other group, and resolve the groups 5-3.</p>

</table>

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b>: Use whatever mitigation you have for the stacks. You won't need it 
in the near future, and it will allow you to survive a 6-2 split.</div>

## Fate Calibration α

If the party has the Enigma Codex buff from the previous phase, clones will 
appear next to each player.

* An arrow from your character will point towards your clone.
* An arrow from your clone will point towards you.
* A faint tether will connect you to your clone.

The effects from Fate Calibration α and β <b>do not</b> come with debuff icons
on the player list, or castbars.

Instead, the **clones** will telegraph the mechanics that will resolve. **Watch
your clones** to see what debuffs they receive.

The debuffs will appear in the same order as they resolve:

1. Ordained Stillness/Motion #1
2. Defamation
3. Shared Sentence + Aggravated Assaults
4. Ordained Stillness/Motion #2 + 3x Sacraments

All players will need to identify the debuffs based on their visual effects
when they resolve.

</div>

When Fate Calibration α finishes its cast, Perfect Alexander will disappear and 
the mechanics that were telegraphed earlier by the clones will now resolve for 
real.

The safe spots to resolve the mechanics will always be opposite one of the two 
*middle* Perfect Alexander clones.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>Fate Calibration α:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Shared Sentence:</b> Left</li>

    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/04/fate_calibration_alpha.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After Fate Calibration α, Perfect Alex will cast the first *Ordained Capital 
Punishment*, which will be shared between both tanks (ST Provokes to take 
hate when Perfect Alexander casts *Ordained Punishment*).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ordained Capital Punishment #1</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>MT + ST full buffs.</p>
      <p>Tank swap from MT to ST.</p>
      <p><em>Stack together for Ordained Capital Punishment, and split up after 
      the third hit.</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Fate Calibration β

Just like Fate Calibration α, clones will appear next to each player that will 
telegraph the upcoming mechanics.

All players will need to identify the debuffs based on their visual effects 
when they resolve.

The debuffs will appear in the same order as they resolve:

1. Light/Dark + tethers
2. Shared Sentence + Super Jumps
3. Collective/Individual Reprobation (stack/spread)
4. Radiant Sacrament

</div>

It's not entirely obvious, but *Fate Calibration β* should be lightly mitigated 
prior to the forced march. Note that you will still need to plan mitigations 
for the upcoming Exatrines.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Fate Calibration β</b>

  </tr>
</table>

Once again, Perfect Alexander will disappear when *Fate Calibration β* finishes 
its cast. The mechanics that were telegraphed earlier by the clones will now 
resolve for real.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1. Initial positions</b></p>

</table>

After Fate Calibration β, Perfect Alexander will cast the second *Ordained 
Capital* Punishment (tankbuster).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ordained Capital Punishment #2</b></td>
    <td><p>ST invuln (solo).</p><p>Tank swap from ST to MT.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Exatrines

*Almighty Judgment* *(also commonly referred to as "Exatrines", after Exaflare 
from UCoB and Trine from O8S)* are a series of three telegraphed ground AoEs 
before resolving for real.

The AoE locations are *not* entirely random- they spawn in a random order from 
the three diagrams shown below. The *only* positions the party will consider
are the ones marked in red:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/04/exatrine_01.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/04/exatrine_02.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/04/exatrine_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that there will *always* be an available 3-to-1 dodge, and the party will
*never* dodge diagonally.

1. Look at the first set of telegraphs. This is where you will *end*.
2. Find the telegraph in the third set that is adjacent to the telegraph in the
   first set. This is where you will *start*.

Each Exatrine is followed by *Irresistable Grace*, an 8-man party stack that
must be heavily mitigated. The recommended mitigation plan is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Exatrine #1</b></td>
    <td>MT Reprisal, MT 90s, H1 120s, H2 shields, H2 30s, D1, D4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Exatrine #2</b></td>
    <td>ST Reprisal, ST 90s, H2 120s, H2 shields, H2 30s, D2, D3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

There will also be one last tankbuster after the first Exatrine.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ordained Capital Punishment #3</b></td>
    <td><p>MT invuln (solo).</p><p>Tank swap from MT to ST.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Temporal Prison

After the second *Irresistable Grace*, Perfect Alexander will then proceed to 
cast *Temporal Prison*, the hard enrage for this fight.

Seven towers/jails appear and resolve, starting from the NE and going clockwise 
around Perfect Alexander.

The jails are resolved with the lowest DPS players going first.
```
H2 > H1 > ST > MT > D3 > D4 > D2 > D1
```
Note that DoTs will continue to tick even after the player has been imprisoned.

  <summary><b>[Exatrines]</b> Why don't we use the center and have the 
  positions in a box? Why use the SW position?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>You <em>can</em> use the center, and some groups do (especially on
      other data centers). However, using the center has a few problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Because the party will dodge the Exaflares from marker-to-marker, 
        using the center gives the impression that dodging from the center of 
        the arena to the east marker (or vice versa) is a viable dodge, while 
        in reality, the party will <em>never</em> dodge Exatrines that way. 
        Putting a marker to the SW puts the Exatrine positions along a single 
        line, lowering the chance of such an accident.</li>
        <li>In addition, because the party is naturally south of the boss, 
        someone calling out "center" <em>can</em> be misinterpreted as "center 
        of the arena", or "center (from west-to-east)", which is the south 
        position. Removing the center of the arena from play gets around this 
        possibility.</li>
        <li>If you use the center of the arena, there is a chance the party 
        dodges from the center of the arena to the south position. As people's
        cameras may be facing north at that point (looking towards the boss), 
        the pillar of light from the first set of Exatrines blocks the screen, 
        making it harder to tell where to stop. By using the SW position, the 
        movement now becomes lateral, so the light pillars are less likely to 
        obstruct players' vision.</li>

      <p>Without the Enigma Codex, there is no way to determine what debuffs 
      players are assigned, or what attacks Perfect Alexander is going to do, 
      and looks something like this:</p>

  <summary><b>[Perfect Alexander]</b> Is Perfect Alexander really impossible
  without the Enigma Codex? Didn't a Chinese group clear without it?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {% include youtube.html id="VG2M2bozu2M" %}
      <p>That group super-shielded Divine Judgment to the point where they 
      didn't need to Tank LB3, which let them cheese Fate Calibration α with a 
      Healer LB3 instead.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the group abused two exploits to clear Fate 
      Calibration β without the codex:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>There was a priority to how tethers are assigned; if, at a certain 
        point in time, there are only 7 players around, the blue tether would 
        simply not be assigned.</li>
        <li>If a player jumps and is mid-air when the forced march from the 
        Light/Dark beacons start, the forced movement time would continue to 
        tick, but the player would not be able to move while they are mid-air, 
        thus shortening the distance travelled from 20 yalms to 17 yalms.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Without knowing who the Beacons are, they had their PLD suicide at a 
      specific time, placed a group in the center of the arena, and spread 
      other players around the outer edge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first exploit where the blue tether doesn't get assigned when
        only 7 people are alive at a specific time let the group nullify the 
        blue tether.</li>
        <li><p>Under normal circumstances, the Light players would run into the 
        Light Beacon, and the Dark players would be repelled away from the Dark
        Beacon and out of the arena.</p>
        <p>However, because the march distance is shortened by jumping, they 
        were able to survive.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/c73cd284013587066d8f9e697fab1db9f007372c/">Patch 6.1</a> 
      fixed this by adding a delay from when players lose control of their 
      character, to when the forced march starts. Now, if you try to jump, 
      this delay will cause the forced march to begin only after your 
      character lands, and you will march the full distance out of the arena.</p>

  <b>[Divine Retribution]</b> What is this? What happened?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This happens when either a Light player touches the Light Beacon, or a 
      Dark player moves too far away from the Dark Beacon.</p>

  <b>[Collective Reprobation (stacks)]</b> Why did the party wipe? What is 
  <em>Faithlessness</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The stacks have an anti-cheese mechanic built into them, and 
      <em>cannot</em> be taken solo.</p>
      <p>When a stack is solo'ed (even with invuln), raid-wide damage called 
      <em>Faithlessness</em> is triggered, which wipes the raid.</p>

  <b>[Fate Calibration β]</b> How did someone get hit with two J Jumps?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This happens when either the Dark Beacon, or the Dark player with no 
      tether forgets to go to the edge of the arena to bait the jump.</p>
      <p>The Alexander clones target the furthest players from them to jump to- 
      if either player forgets to bait this, then the Dark player with the blue 
      tether (who is south) becomes the furthest player for <b>two</b> of the 
      Alexanders.</p>
