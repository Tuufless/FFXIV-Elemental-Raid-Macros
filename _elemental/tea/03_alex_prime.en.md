# Alexander Prime

After defeating Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser, the arena will change and
Alexander Prime appears alongside Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser to begin the
transition mechanic to this phase.

## Temporal Stasis

After *Temporal Stasis*, the **ST** will take aggro and invuln Alexander 
Prime's *Chastening Heat*. **This invuln should be timed** to also absorb the 
three *Divine Spear* cleaves that follow.

Alternatively, you can mitigate the *Chastening Heat*, and invuln the *Divine 
Spears* (there will be one auto-attack in between).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat + Divine Spears #1</b></td>
    <td><p>ST invuln.</p><p>Tank swap from ST to MT after the Divine Spears.</p></td>

After the *Divine Spears*, have the MT Provoke and take aggro. Alexander Prime 
will autoattack twice before casting *Inception Formation*.

Spears*.

  Heat</em> is being cast (have the ST point the <em>Divine Spears</em> east).</p>

Alexander Prime then auto-attacks twice and casts *Wormhole Formation*.

## Wormhole Formation

Wormhole Formation will use 09STOP's method (highlighted by the [Korean simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdo02A5GbNPA9B4HN-NOt-vnTPyv2elH/view)).

Remember that **all odd numbered players must face outside the arena and use 
Arm's Length/Surecast** when baiting Cruise Chaser to nullify the knockback 
from *Alpha Sword*.

*Wormhole Formation* ends with another set of *Enumerations*, which you can
resolve one of two ways:

### Method 1 - Melee swap

This resolves the *Enumerations* in exactly the same way as in the Brute
Justice + Cruise Chaser phase.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>12.</b> Resolve <em>Enumeration</em> the same way as Brute Justice 
      + Cruise Chaser.</p>

        <li><b>H1</b>, <b>D3</b>: Always west <em>Enumeration</em>.</li>
        <li><b>H2</b>, <b>D4</b>: Always east <em>Enumeration</em>.</li>
        <li><b>D1</b>: West <em>Enumeration</em> unless a swap is needed.</li>
        <li><b>D2</b>: East <em>Enumeration</em> unless a swap is needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If either side has both <em>Enumerations</em> (or equivalently, no 
      <em>Enumerations</em>), <b>D1</b> and <b>D2</b> swap sides.</p>
      <div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
      <b>Tip:</b> If you are D1 or D2 and you see four people on your side, 
      you need to swap <em>(because your counterpart has already swapped, but
      you haven't)</em>.</div>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/03/wormhole_12.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Method 2 - TTD/HHD

This is a different method to resolve the *Enumerations* that some may find
easier.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>12.</b> Resolve <em>Enumeration</em> with a North and South group.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT</b>, <b>ST</b>: Always inside the North <em>Enumeration</em>.</li>
        <li><b>H1</b>, <b>H2</b>: Always inside the South <em>Enumeration</em>.</li>
        <li><b>DPS with <em>Enumeration</em>:</b> Go North/South according to the priority:
        <p style="text-align:center"><b>North:</b> D1 > D2 > D3 > D4 <b>:South</b></p></li>
        <li><b>DPS without <em>Enumeration</em>:</b> Stay out of both Enumerations.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/03/wormhole_12_ttdhhd.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Pair-wise movement

Broken down into the major steps, here's what each pair does. Note that what 
each pair does is **independent from the rest of the party**, so you can focus 
on executing your part.

All the action happens north and south. If it's not your turn to do anything, 
or if you're done, return to the East/West positions.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>1 and 2</b></td>
    <td>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when the Chakrams fly.</b></li>

        <li>Bait <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em> from Brute Justice.</li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>3 and 4</b></td>

        <li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (3) and dash (4) south.</li>
        <li>Dodge <em>Sacrament</em> lasers from Alexander.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>5 and 6</b></td>
    <td>
      <ol>
        <li>Soak <b>first</b> set of puddles.</li>
        <li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when the puddles resolve.</b></li>
        <li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (5) and dash (6) north.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>7 and 8</b></td>
    <td>
      <ol>
        <li>Soak <b>second</b> set of puddles.</li>
        <li><b>Arm's Length/Surecast when the puddles resolve.</b></li>
        <li>Resolve Cruise Chaser's cleave (7) and dash (8) south.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the *Enumeration* at the end of *Wormhole Formation*, Alexander Prime 
will respawn back in the center of the arena and cast two *Mega Holies* 
back-to-back.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mega Holy x2</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>MT Reprisal, D1, D4</p>
      <p><em>(If timed correctly, Reprisal, Feint, and Addle will cover 
      <b>both</b> Mega Holies)</em>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the two *Mega Holies*, Alexander Prime will then cast *Summon Alexander* 
before disappearing.

---

## J Waves

All three bosses will reappear, with Brute Justice landing with a *J Storm*.

- Cruise Chaser and Alexander Prime will immediately start casting their 
  enrages.
- Brute Justice will hit the party with periodic *J Wave* raid damage roughly 
  each GCD.
- Each *J Wave* also gives Brute Justice a damage-up stack (max 16).

The party will need to (in order):

1. Defeat Cruise Chaser. *(Cruise Chaser's enrage finishes before Brute 
   Justice's 8th stack.)*
2. Defeat Brute Justice. *(This will allow the party to damage Alexander 
   Prime.)*
3. Defeat Alexander Prime. *(Alexander Prime is invulnerable while BJCC are 
   still around. If you have time, build gauge to prepare for the reopener at 
   Perfect Alexander.)*

As *J Waves* hit progressively harder, you will need to plan party mitigations 
accordingly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 6 stacks:</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>MT 90s, ST 90s, H1 120s, H2 120s</p>
      <p><em>(This should be around the time Cruise Chaser dies.)</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 8 stacks:</b></td>
    <td><p>ST Reprisal, H2 30s, D2, D3</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 10 stacks:</b></td>
    <td>Any remaining mitigations</td>
  </tr>
</table>

When Alexander Prime is defeated, a countdown to *Divine Judgment* will begin. 
If Alexander did not enrage, this will be survivable with a Tank LB3 and 
mitigations.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Divine Judgment</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>Tank LB3, H2 shields, H2 30s</p>
      <p><em>(Tank LB3 when the countdown reaches ~4 seconds.)</em>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The party then proceeds onto Perfect Alexander.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Temporal Stasis]</b> Why does the blue-tethered player on Cruise 
  Chaser's side have to take a few steps towards Cruise Chaser?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Cruise Chaser cleaves the three closest players to it.</p>
      <p>If the player with the blue tether on Cruise Chaser's side goes all
      the way to the arena's edge, the three closest players to Cruise Chaser 
      now become:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two players just north and south of Cruise Chaser.</li>
        <li><b>One of the players at Brute Justice</b> instead of the player 
        with the blue tether.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This will kill everybody on that side of the arena.</p>

  <b>[Temporal Stasis]</b> Why does the ST take aggro at the start of the 
  fight instead of the MT?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This lets the ST invuln the first <em>Chastening Heat</em>, which:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows the party to tank invuln both sets of <em>Chastening 
        Heats</em>, as the MT's invuln will be back up for the second (after 
        <em>Inception Formation</em>).</li>
        <li>Allows the ST to invuln the second <em>Ordained Capital 
        Punishment</em> in Perfect Alexander, even if they are a PLD.</li>

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Criss-crossing the tethers prevents the green orbs (particularly the 
      lower ones) from moving in the path of the players trying to place their 
      crystals.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Inception]</b> Why do we place the crystals in a square?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The crystals need to be placed in a way such that the True Heart that 
      spawns opposite Alexander hits all four crystals. Then will turn the 
      True Heart gold and give the party the Enigma Codex buff.</p>
      <p>The Enigma Codex buff is necessary in order to clear Perfect 
      Alexander.</p>
      <p>When the True Heart hits a crystal, it deals proximity damage to all 
      players. As a result, we want to place them as far away from the party 
      as we can.</p>

  <b>[Inception]</b> Is Perfect Alexander really impossible without 
  the Enigma Codex? Didn't a Chinese group clear without it?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      {% include youtube.html id="VG2M2bozu2M" %}
      <p>That group super-shielded Divine Judgment to the point where they 
      didn't need to Tank LB3, which let them cheese Fate Calibration Î± with a 
      Healer LB3 instead.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the group abused a timing issue with the forced 
      march in Fate Calibration Î², where if a player jumped and was mid-air 
      when the mechanic starts, the forced movement time would continue to 
      tick, but the player would not be able to move while they are mid-air and
      not be marched out of the arena as a result.</p>
      <p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/c73cd284013587066d8f9e697fab1db9f007372c/">Patch 6.1</a>
      fixed this by adding a delay from when players lose control of their 
      character, to when the forced march starts. Now, if you try to jump, this 
      delay will cause the forced march to begin only after your character 
      lands, and you will march the full distance out of the arena.</p>

<table>

  <b>[Wormhole]</b> How are players getting clipped by <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is quite common while learning the strat, and is the technical 
      part of executing the strat.</p>
      <p>First off, check that the people that are taking the Void puddles
      aren't moving too close to the center of the arena, since that would 
      obviously put them in the <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em>'s AoE.</p>
      <p>More likely, either Player 3 or Player 4 (whoever wasn't baiting 
      <em>Super Jump</em>) gets killed by an <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em>, in 
      which case check the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Was the <em>Super Jump</em> baited in front of the red dot?</li>
        <li>Was the player not baiting <em>Super Jump</em> all the way at the 
        edge of the arena?</li>
        <li>Did the player responsible for baiting <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em> 
        (either Player 1 or Player 2) move out of position early? <em>(This 
        will tilt the Apocalyptic Ray slightly, enough to kill the other 
        player- see the diagram.)</em></li>
