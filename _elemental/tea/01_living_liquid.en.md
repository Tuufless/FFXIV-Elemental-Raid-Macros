# Living Liquid

This is a modified version of the original [Separations Living Liquid strat](http://laytina14.com/archives/20887361.html).

Notable changes are:
- The MT Provokes the Liquid Hand and invulns the first set of *Fluid Swings*
  and the *Protean Wave* from the "north" puddle.
- The first set of *Protean Waves* are baited by the MT and both healers,
  instead of both healers and D3.
- The DPS positions for the final set of *Protean Waves* are different.

<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Liquid Hand mechanics</b></summary>
<p>The Liquid Hand is an add that spawns when Living Liquid casts the first 
<em>Cascade</em> in the fight. It has two key mechanics:</p>
<p><b>Hand of Parting</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Liquid Hand will glow blue and turn into an open palm, or a closed
  fist.</li>
  <li>After a few seconds, the Liquid Hand will slam on the ground, dealing
    raid-wide damage based on its distance to Living Liquid:
    <ul>
      <li>If the Hand was <b>an open palm</b>: Stack the Hand on top of Living
      Liquid.</li>
      <li>If the Hand was <b>a closed fist</b>: Separate the Hand and Living
      Liquid.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Whether the Hand turns into a closed fist or an open palm <b>can be
  baited.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>If Living Liquid and the Hand are <b>separated</b>, the Hand will
      glow with an open palm.</li>
      <li>If Living Liquid and the Hand are <b>near one another</b>, the Hand
      will glow with <b>a closed fist</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We will <em>always</em> want the Liquid Hand to turn to an open
  palm.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hand of Pain</b></p>
<p>The Liquid Hand will slam the ground, and deal raid-wide damage based on the
HP% difference between Living Liquid and the Liquid Hand.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Living Liquid and the Liquid Hand's HP% must be <b>within 5%</b> to not
  deal lethal damage.</li>
  <li>This damage ignores tank invulnerability.</li>
</ul>
</details>
</div>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Pull Living Liquid to the center of the arena.</p>
      <p>Living Liquid will auto-attack three times, before cleaving the MT
      with a <em>Fluid Swing</em>.</p>
      <p>Living Liquid then casts the first <em>Cascade</em>, which spawns the
      Liquid Hand and three water puddles.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The party orients themselves to the three water puddles.</li>
        <li><b>MT, ST:</b> Separate Living Liquid and Hand to force Liquid Hand
        to an open palm.</li>
      </ul>
      <div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
      <b>Tip:</b> If the ST is having trouble taking the Liquid Hand's hate
      from the MT, the MT can momentarily turn off their tank stance when the
      Liquid Hand spawns to let the ST secure hate.</div>
      <p>As a rough guide, we split the party as such:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT, H1, D1, D3:</b> Living Liquid</li>
        <li><b>ST, H2, D2, D4:</b> Liquid Hand</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/01/living_liquid_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> If Liquid Hand has been sufficiently separated from Living
      Liquid, it will now glow as an open palm.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> Provoke the Liquid Hand to stack it on top of Living Liquid.</li>
        <li><b>MT, H1, H2:</b> Bait the first set of (telegraphed) <em>Protean
        Waves</em> from the water puddles.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
	  <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/tea/01/living_liquid_02.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Liquid Hand does *not* need to be defeated to clear the phase- however, its
HP needs to be kept close to Living Liquid's because of *Hand of Pain*.

## Jagd Dolls

This is the first major section of the fight that introduces the Jagd Dolls,
which are a one-time mechanic, but also introduces the puddle's *Protean
Waves*.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Jagd Dolls breakdown</b></summary>
<p>The Jagd Dolls are adds that have the following mechanics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Jagd Dolls tether to the first player that performs any action on
  them (including auto-attacks), and lock onto that player.</li>
  <li>They periodically pulse with <em>Exhaust</em>, a point-blank AoE that
  applies a stacking <em>Luminous Aetheroplasm</em> on any player hit.
  <ul>
    <li>If any player is hit with two AoEs, they explode and wipe the raid.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Jagd Dolls <b>cannot</b> be destroyed by damage- they will explode
  and wipe the raid if they reach 0% HP.
  <ul>
    <li>To destroy them, they need to be dragged near either Living Liquid
    <em>or</em> the Liquid Hand. Doing so will tether them to the boss and 
    destroy them, dealing raid-wide damage to the party <em>(Reducible
    Complexity)</em> based on its current HP.</li>
    <li>The Jagd Doll <b>must be under 25% HP</b>, or the explosion will deal 
    lethal damage.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</details>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Puddle's Protean Waves</b></summary>
<ol>
  <li>Each puddle targets the closest player to them with a cone telegraph.</li>
  <li>When the telegraph disappears, a cone <em>Protean Wave</em> fires where
  the telegraph was. This <em>Protean Wave</em> will also knockback any players
  hit (although this can be stopped with <em>Arm's Length/Surecast</em>).</li>
  <li>Finally, a second <b>untelegraphed</b> <em>Protean Wave</em> fires at the
  closest player. This <em>Protean Wave</em> cannot be avoided, but doesn't
  knockback.</li>
</ol>
<p>All <em>Protean Waves</em> also apply a 5-second <em>Water Resistance Down
II</em> debuff on the players they hit (so a player cannot get hit by more than
one).</p>
</details>
</div>

      </ul>
      <p>The Liquid Hand will also use <em>Hand of Parting</em> here. The Hand
      should've been an open palm, which will wipe the raid unless the Liquid
      Hand is stacked on top of Living Liquid.</p>

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b> From here on, the ST will generally take more damage than the MT,
as the Liquid Hand will auto-attack more over the rest of the phase.</div>

## Protean Waves #1

This section of the fight now introduces Living Liquid's *Protean Waves*, which
are similar to the puddle's *Protean Waves*, with a few differences.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Living Liquid's Protean Waves</b></summary>
<ol>
  <li>Living Liquid targets each player with a cone telegraph.</li>
  <li>When the telegraphs disappear, a cone <em>Protean Wave</em> fires where
  the telegraph was. This <em>Protean Wave</em> will also knockback any players
  hit (although this can be stopped with <em>Arm's Length/Surecast</em>).</li>
  <li><p>Living Liquid then fires <b>two sets</b> of <b>five untelegraphed</b>
  <em>Protean Waves</em>, one after the other:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <b>four closest players</b> to Living Liquid.</li>
      <li>A fifth <em>Protean Wave</em> in front of Living Liquid, <b>in the
      direction Living Liquid is facing.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>This last sets of <em>Protean Waves</em> cannot be avoided, but do not
knockback.</p>
<p>All <em>Protean Waves</em> also apply a 5-second <em>Water Resistance Down
II</em> debuff on the players they hit (so a player cannot get hit by more than
one).</p>

## Protean Waves #2

*Protean Waves* with a set of *Protean Waves* from the puddles.
