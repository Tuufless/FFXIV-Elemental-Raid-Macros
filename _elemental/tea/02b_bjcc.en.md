# Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser

My preferred method of doing this phase is using [my Tollgate strat](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/10898230/blog/4941271/)
that is very similar to MOOF's strat that stacks both bosses in the middle.

The "Tollgate" name comes from the third Nisi pass, where the tanks and healers
line up to take/pass Nisi. Someone mentioned that passing Nisi here felt like
passing through a tollgate, and the name stuck.

The strat simplifies the Water/Lightning and Nisi passes, **but at the cost of
increased Tank damage.** This phase is already one of the more
healing-intensive fights, so be prepared.

Tanks should try to have minor cooldowns available for the Lightning passes.

      <p>At a basic level, the tanks will keep both bosses stacked in the
      center, with some healer movement.</p>
      <p>The DPS make up much of the movement in this phase.</p>

## Mechanics

This phase contains two "hot potato" loops that the party must handle 
simultaneously.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Loop 1: Compressed Water/Lightning breakdown</b></summary>
<p>These are two 30-second debuffs that are applied on two players when Brute 
Justice casts <em>Link-up</em>.</p>
<p>When the timer expires, the debuffs explode in a shared-damage AoE 
(<em>Crashing Wave</em> and <em>Crashing Thunder</em>), centered on the 
affected player.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the player with the debuff ever dies, the debuff explodes and wipe the 
  raid.</li>
  <li>After the explosion, the debuff transfers to a random player that was hit.</li>
  <li>If the debuff cannot be passed to a new player this way (e.g: nobody else
  was hit), it explodes and wipes the raid.</li>
  <li>The player that originally had the debuff gets an elemental resistance
  down debuff, so they <em>cannot</em> participate in two stacks of the same 
  element in a row.</li>
</ul>

        <li>A waterspout will also spawn where the debuffed player was standing.
        <ul>
          <li>Players that move or stay too near this waterspout will be
          instantly killed.</li>
          <li>The waterspout must either be frozen with Brute Justice's Ice, or 
          destroyed with fire from Brute Justice's <em>Flarethrower</em>.

        result in a wipe.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>
</div>

The party must keep both debuff loops going, passing *Compressed Water*, 
*Compressed Lightning*, and all Nisis around until Brute Justice casts *Gavel*, 
which removes all the debuffs.

After the *Apocalyptic Ray*, Cruise Chaser casts two *Whirlwinds* (one after
the other) before both bosses start casting their enrage (*Eternal Darkness* 
and *Final Sentence*).

If either boss dies, the other starts casting their enrage.

## Passing Nisi (after Verdict)

Here are some examples on passing Nisis during the third pass.

At this time, either all the tanks and healers have Nisi (who the DPS need to
collect the appropriate Nisis from), or the DPS have all the Nisis (which they
need to pass to the appropriate tank or healer).

        <li>SMN collects blue Nisi from DRK.</li>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
<b>[Tank swap]</b> Why don't we do a Provoke swap instead of having the two
tanks cross each other (especially with Nisi)?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If a tank happens to die in <em>Limit Cut</em> and gets raised at
        the start of BJCC, their first instinct is to <em>Provoke</em>
        whichever boss they're supposed to hold. Now that <em>Provoke</em> is 
        on cooldown, it cannot be used to swap the bosses after Chakrams go
        off.</li>
        <li>Cruise Chaser stops to cast <em>Photon</em>. If you swap bosses 
        using <em>Provoke</em>, the tank that Provokes Brute Justice can only
        attack Cruise Chaser, and either has to hold damage, potentially steal
        hate back, or resort to stance dancing tricks that is more trouble than
        it is worth.</li>

<b>[Hidden Mines]</b> Why doesn't D3 bait the west Hidden Mine instead of H1?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The objective is to have both Enumeration targets visible and in close
      proximity to one another.</p>
      <p>Suppose D3 and H2 baited the Hidden Mines instead and D2 and D3 were
      targeted for Enumeration.</p>
      <p>D2 only sees the Enumeration on D2, but now has to look at D3 to
      determine whether they need to switch positions with D1, with two giant
      robots in the center blocking the view.</p>
    </td>

<summary>
<b>[Hidden Mines]</b> Why don't we bait the Hidden Mines towards the outer edge
of the arena? Doesn't that put the healers further away from Brute Justice so a
ranged DPS doesn't bait a Hidden Mine by mistake?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The idea is to keep both bosses in the center. In particular, if the
      West mine is baited towards the edge, the MT has to pull Cruise Chaser
      closer to the edge in order to take the Hidden Mine, and doesn't leave
      much space for the DPS to fit in for the Plasma Shield.</p>
      <p>Of course, you could have the MT and ST switch sides again to recenter
      the bosses, but that violates a different principle which is to try and
      keep the tanks and healers to their half of the arena as much as
      possible.</p>

<summary>
<b>[Plasma Shield]</b> Why are all four DPS on the Plasma Shield? Isn't that
overkill?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Yes, it's overkill.</p>
      <p>You really only need three DPS to destroy the Plasma Shield in time,
      but this is a single point of failure and having all four DPS on the
      shield is insurance against someone targeting the wrong thing by
      accident, or one of the DPS angled too far from the shield's front so
      they don't do any damage.</p>

<b>[Gavel]</b> What happens if you kill Brute Justice before <em>Gavel</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Alas, this is not feasible- if Brute Justice dies before
      <em>Gavel</em> resolves, he does an instantcast <em>Final Sentence</em>
      on the way out, killing everybody <em>even if</em> the debuffs from
      <em>Verdict</em> have not yet been assigned.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
<b>[Crashing Thunder]</b> Why did this deal more damage than usual?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Water and Lightning work differently.</p>
      <p>While <em>Crashing Wave</em> works like any other stack damage (damage
      is lowered as more people are hit by <em>Crashing Wave</em>), Lightning 
      is the opposite; damage <em>increases</em> as more people are hit by
      <em>Crashing Thunder</em>.</p>
      <p>This is why we want the Lightning stacks to contain exactly two 
      players.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Compressed Water]</b> What is "Severe Contamination"?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is the pulsing raid-wide damage that you get if the waterspout
      left behind from <em>Compressed Water</em> is not frozen or destroyed
      by <em>Flarethrower</em>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
<b>[Hidden Mines]</b> What went wrong with the Hidden Mine baits? Why was a 
mine baited on the DPS instead of a healer?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The Hidden Mines are baited by the two furthest players from Brute
      Justice, which should be the healers.</p>
      <p>If a DPS ended up baiting the Hidden Mine, it is likely because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A DPS was outside the green sector marked in Step 7 above
        <em>or</em></li>
        <li>The ST did not position Brute Justice in the center of the
        arena.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Plasma Shield]</b> How did the MT get one-shot?</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Cruise Chaser gains a damage-up buff if the Plasma Shield is not
      destroyed in time, and its auto-attack will one-shot the MT.</p>
      <p>Even if the MT survives this, the follow-up Whirlwind (before
      third Water) will wipe the party.</p>
