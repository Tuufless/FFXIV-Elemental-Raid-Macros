# Gaia and Shiva

The Usurper of Frost will respawn at either North or South, whichever is
further from where The Oracle of Darkness was defeated.

**Both tanks start with their tank stance on**, and take first and second aggro
on the Usurper of Frost- her auto-attacks hit the top *two* players in aggro,
and we need to build hate for later.

### Fragment of Fate

The Usurper of Frost casts *Materialization*, which spawns the Fragment of Fate
North.

Over the course of the phase, the Fragment of Fate will take damage. Assuming
no player hits it with an AoE, it will survive with barely any HP.

This means that if it takes *any* extra damage (from an enemy AoE that targets 
a player), the phase becomes impossible to clear (although you'll still be able
to get practice in.)

      each player was standing. Simply move away when the boss transforms.</p>

The Oracle of Darkness then respawns a little east of center, before
teleporting south.

Two things need to happen:

1. Both tanks **turn their tank stance off** (we do *not* want the tanks to
   hold hate on the Oracle of Darkness).
2. Everybody swap over and attack the Oracle of Darkness (along with the
   2-minute burst).

They will shortly begin their first joint mechanic.

## Darklit Dragonsong - Vertical spreads

Both bosses will cast *Darklit Dragonsong*.

- The Usurper of Frost will deal raidwide damage.
- The Oracle of Darkness will apply tethers and *Dark Water III* debuffs on the
  party.

        tethers.</li>
        <li>Two random players get <em>Dark Water III</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>One player will have <em>both</em> tethers <em>and</em> Water.</p>

To resolve the tethers, we need the tethers to make a "bowtie".

To summarise, the tethered healer will always go North. For everybody else:

- **If you are tethered to a healer:** Go south.
- **If you are tethered, but not to a healer:** Go north.

With the tethers sorted out, the next thing we need to do is separate the two
*Dark Water III* debuffs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>6.</b> If the two <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are on different 
      sides (North vs. South), then no further adjustments need to be made.</p>
      <p>If the <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are either both North, or both
      South, then the Water player and their partner swap sides.</p>
      <p>Do this <b>before the towers resolve</b>.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, since both Water debuffs are in the North group,
      the non-tether Water (H1) and their partner (MT) switch places.)</em></p>

## Akh Morn 1 - 6:2

The two bosses will then teleport a bit West and East of the center for *Akh
Morn* into *Morn Afah*.

*Morn Afah* is also a boss HP check, and the two bosses must be within 5% HP of
each other, or *Morn Afah* will be lethal. If they are not within 5% HP, the
two bosses will tether together indicating which boss has too much HP.

- **White tether:** The Usurper of Frost has too much HP.
- **Purple tether:** The Oracle of Darkness has too much HP.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> <em>Morn Afah</em> originates from the Usurper of Frost, not
  the Oracle of Darkness.</p>
  <p>If the HP difference is too large (i.e: the bosses are tethered together),
  the tank that's holding the Usurper of Frost can sacrifice themselves to save
  the party from wiping to <em>Morn Afah</em>.</p>
</div>

## Crystallize Time

The bosses will cast *Crystallize Time*. This is probably the hardest part of
the encounter, so hang in there.

- Six hourglasses will spawn.
- The Usurper of Frost will apply a set of debuffs on the players to resolve.
- The Oracle of Darkness will deal raidwide damage and tether to four
  hourglasses.
  - The North and South hourglasses with yellow tethers.
  - Two of the remaining opposite hourglasses with purple tethers.

We have chosen to go with Nukemaru's anti-kb "Y-shaped" strat that's done in 
Mana.

While the positioning is much simpler, it has *considerable* mitigation
requirements. Both tanks will need their 40% personal mitigations, and you
will also need *at least* three 10% party-mitigations.

## Akh Morn 2 - 6:2

The two bosses will reappear around the center of the arena and immediately 
start another 4-hit *Akh Morn* into *Morn Afah* sequence.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>26.</b> The two bosses target whoever has their hate with a 4-hit
      <em>Akh Morn</em> (which again, should be a tank, and non-tank).</p>

      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru/04/akh_morn_01.jpg">

  </tr>
</table>

Notably, the Fragment of Fate will do one round of *Edge of Oblivion* just
before the *Morn Afah* resolves, so any shields will need to be reapplied.

Also remember that two bosses have to be within 5% HP of each other for *Morn
Afah*. If things are looking bad, *Morn Afah* comes from the Usurper of Frost,
so the MT can sacrifice themselves and take it away from the party if needed.

Both bosses will then start casting their respective enrages (*Absolute Zero*
and *Memory's End*).

**Remember to have both tanks turn their tank stance back on.**

When both bosses are defeated, there will be a knockback from the center, and 
you will advance to the next arena.

If the Fragment of Fate is not around, Eden's Promise will spawn and wipe the
raid. If, on the other hand, the Fragment of Fate is still alive, then the
party advances to the final phase.

  <b>[Fragment of Fate]</b> Does the Fragment of Fate still spawn if the
  Crystals of Darkness were destroyed earlier?

      <p><em>Materialization</em> will always spawn a Fragment of Fate,
      regardless of whether the Crystals of Darkness were destroyed.</p>
      <p>However, if the Crystals of Darkness are destroyed, the memory will be
      changed and the name of the raidwide that it periodically casts is named
      <em>Depths of Oblivion</em> instead of <em>Edge of Oblivion</em>. They
      both do the same amount of damage.</p>

  <b>[Tank stance]</b> Why do the tanks remove tank stance when the Oracle of 
  Darkness spawns?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is done to facilitate the 6:2 <em>Akh Morn</em> strategy.</p>
      <p>The Usurper of Frost auto-attacks the two top players in aggro- this
      should be the two tanks.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the Oracle of Darkness <em>does not autoattack</em>. This
      means that a tank does not necessarily need to hold hate on the Oracle of
      Darkness.</p>
      <p>Resolving 6:2 <em>Akh Morn</em> is safer because a tank death does not
      necessarily lead to a wipe. However, in order to do this, a non-tank must
      hold aggro on the Oracle of Darkness, which is why the tanks turn their
      stance off- we need to ensure that a healer or DPS holds her aggro
      instead.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Darklit Dragonsong]</b> Why vertical spreads (groups E/W) instead of
  horizontal (groups N/S)?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are a number of problems with lining up horizontally
      North/South, which are solved by lining up vertically instead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Oracle of Darkness spawns south. However, if the tanks are
        North, then the ST has to step out of formation in order to maintain
        aggro for the upcoming <em>Akh Morn</em>, potentially confusing the
        rest of the party.</li>
        <li>The Oracle of Darkness also spawns a significant amount of time
        <em>after</em> the Usurper of Frost, and their HP needs to be equalised
        before the first <em>Morn Afah</em>. However, with the tanks North,
        they are unable to help without breaking formation.</li>
        <li>Lining the DPS up horizontally also means that the two non-tethered
        DPS could be D1+D2, or D3+D4. In such an event, either D2 or D3 would
        have to cross over to the other side of the boss, which isn't ideal.
        In contrast, a vertical lineup guarantees that exactly two tether
        players are on each East/West side of the bosses.</li>

<summary>
  <b>[Darklit Dragonsong]</b> Why do we rotate instead of just swapping the
  tank and the North-most DPS?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>With the two bosses in the way, it's quite annoying to look at the
      other side- rotating means that all adjustments are contained to your
      side of the bosses.</p>
      <p>Rotating also allows both DPS to rotate into the Oracle of Darkness
      in the event of an hourglass, which is an advantage because the Oracle
      of Darkness will have higher HP at the time, so it's better to have DPS
      on her instead of a tank.</p>
      <p>Not having players cross over to the other side also means that it's
      easier for the non-tether Water player to adjust.</p>

      <p>The problem with 7:1 is that if a tank dies to either <em>Darklit

      have aggro on both bosses, and thus get both Light and Dark debuffs from 
      <em>Akh Morn</em>, quickly leading to a wipe.</p>

        <li>It gives more time for the blue <em>Wyrmfang</em> players to pick
        up their puddles, because they don't have to travel as far to join the

        <li>It lets the party spread use their standard clock positions for

<summary>
  <b>[Crystallize Time (Hallowed Wings)]</b> Just <em>how</em> does this mechanic work?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>As mentioned, the first player hit takes the most damage, and that
      damage goes down the further down the line you go.</p>
      <p>More specifically, the base damage numbers are approximately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st player: ~160k damage</li>
        <li>2nd player: ~70k damage</li>
        <li>3rd player: ~55k damage</li>
        <li>4th player: ~55k damage</li>
        <li>5th player: ~40k damage</li>
        <li>6th player: ~15k damage</li>
        <li>7th player: ~10k damage</li>
        <li>8th player: ~10k damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, the first four players hit also get a <em>Magic 
      Vulnerability Up</em> debuff. This debuff increases the damage taken to
      400%, which means that the fifth player hit with vuln (400% x ~40k
      damage) takes roughly the same damage as the first player without (~160k
      damage).</p>
      <p>Note that these are <em>base</em> values, so multiply them roughly by
      0.64 for tanks, and 0.94 for casters/healers.</p>
