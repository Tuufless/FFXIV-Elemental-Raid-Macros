# Gaia and Shiva

The Usurper of Frost will respawn at either North or South, whichever is
further from where The Oracle of Darkness was defeated.

**Both tanks start with their tank stance on**, and take first and second aggro
on the Usurper of Frost- her auto-attacks hit the top *two* players in aggro,
and we need to build hate for later.

### Fragment of Fate

The Usurper of Frost casts *Materialization*, which spawns the Fragment of Fate
North.

Over the course of the phase, the Fragment of Fate will take damage. Assuming
no player hits it with an AoE, it will survive with barely any HP.

This means that if it takes *any* extra damage (from an enemy AoE that targets 
a player), the phase becomes impossible to clear (although you'll still be able
to get practice in.)

The Oracle of Darkness then respawns a little east of center, before
teleporting south.

Two things need to happen:

1. Both tanks **turn their tank stance off** (we do *not* want the tanks to
   hold hate on the Oracle of Darkness).
2. Everybody swap over and attack the Oracle of Darkness (along with the
   2-minute burst).

They will shortly begin their first joint mechanic.

## Darklit Dragonsong - Vertical spreads

Both bosses will cast *Darklit Dragonsong*.

- The Usurper of Frost will deal raidwide damage.
- The Oracle of Darkness will apply tethers and *Dark Water III* debuffs on the
  party.

        <li>Two random players get <em>Dark Water III</em>.</li>

To resolve the tethers, we need the tethers to make a "bowtie".

To summarise, the tethered healer will always go North. For everybody else:

- **If you are tethered to a healer:** Go south.
- **If you are tethered, but not to a healer:** Go north.

With the tethers sorted out, the next thing we need to do is separate the two
*Dark Water III* debuffs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>5.</b> If the two <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are on different 
      sides (North vs. South), then no further adjustments need to be made.</p>
      <p>If the <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are either both North, or both
      South, then the Water player and their partner swap sides.</p>
      <p>Do this <b>before the towers resolve</b>.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, since both Water debuffs are in the North group,
      the non-tether Water (H1) and their partner (MT) switch places.)</em></p>

      to avoid accidentally getting clipped by the second hit.</p>

## Akh Morn 1 - 6:2

The two bosses will then teleport a bit West and East of the center for *Akh
Morn* into *Morn Afah*.

*Morn Afah* is also a boss HP check, and the two bosses must be within 5% HP of
each other, or *Morn Afah* will be lethal. If they are not within 5% HP, the
two bosses will tether together indicating which boss has too much HP.

- **White tether:** The Usurper of Frost has too much HP.
- **Purple tether:** The Oracle of Darkness has too much HP.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> <em>Morn Afah</em> originates from the Usurper of Frost, not
  the Oracle of Darkness.</p>
  <p>If the HP difference is too large (i.e: the bosses are tethered together),
  the tank that's holding the Usurper of Frost can sacrifice themselves to save
  the party from wiping to <em>Morn Afah</em>.</p>
</div>

## Crystallize Time

The bosses will cast *Crystallize Time*. This is probably the hardest part of
the encounter, so hang in there.

- Six hourglasses will spawn.
- The Usurper of Frost will apply a set of debuffs on the players to resolve.
- The Oracle of Darkness will deal raidwide damage and tether to four
  hourglasses.
  - The North and South hourglasses with yellow tethers.
  - Two of the remaining opposite hourglasses with purple tethers.

We have chosen to go with Nukemaru's anti-kb "Y-shaped" strat that's done in 
Mana.

While the positioning is much simpler, it has *considerable* mitigation
requirements. Both tanks will need their 40% personal mitigations, and you
will also need *at least* three 10% party-mitigations.

## Akh Morn 2 - 6:2

The two bosses will reappear around the center of the arena and immediately 
start another 4-hit *Akh Morn* into *Morn Afah* sequence.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>26.</b> The two bosses target whoever has their hate with a 4-hit
      <em>Akh Morn</em> (which again, should be a tank, and non-tank).</p>

Notably, the Fragment of Fate will do one round of *Edge of Oblivion* just
before the *Morn Afah* resolves, so any shields will need to be reapplied.

Also remember that two bosses have to be within 5% HP of each other for *Morn
Afah*. If things are looking bad, *Morn Afah* comes from the Usurper of Frost,
so the MT can sacrifice themselves and take it away from the party if needed.

Both bosses will then start casting their respective enrages (*Absolute Zero*
and *Memory's End*).

**Remember to have both tanks turn their tank stance back on.**

When both bosses are defeated, there will be a knockback from the center, and 
you will advance to the next arena.

If the Fragment of Fate is not around, Eden's Promise will spawn and wipe the
raid. If, on the other hand, the Fragment of Fate is still alive, then the
party advances to the final phase.

  <b>[Tank stance]</b> Why do the tanks remove tank stance when the Oracle of 
  Darkness spawns?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is done to facilitate the 6:2 <em>Akh Morn</em> strategy.</p>
      <p>The Usurper of Frost auto-attacks the two top players in aggro- this
      should be the two tanks.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the Oracle of Darkness <em>does not autoattack</em>. This
      means that a tank does not necessarily need to hold hate on the Oracle of
      Darkness.</p>
      <p>Resolving 6:2 <em>Akh Morn</em> is safer because a tank death does not
      necessarily lead to a wipe. However, in order to do this, a non-tank must
      hold aggro on the Oracle of Darkness, which is why the tanks turn their
      stance off- we need to ensure that a healer or DPS holds her aggro
      instead.</p>

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>As mentioned, the first player hit takes the most damage, and that
      damage goes down the further down the line you go.</p>
      <p>More specifically, the base damage numbers are approximately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st player: ~160k damage</li>
        <li>2nd player: ~70k damage</li>

      <p>In addition, the first four players hit also get a <em>Magic 
      Vulnerability Up</em> debuff. This debuff increases the damage taken to
      400%, which means that the fifth player hit with vuln (400% x ~40k
      damage) takes roughly the same damage as the first player without (~160k

## Strategy Related Questions

<summary>
  <b>[Darklit Dragonsong]</b> Why vertical Darklit over horizontal?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Horizontal Darklit (where the groups line up horizontally North and
      South) may be more commonplace because this is how <em>Light Rampant</em> 
      tethers were resolved in E8S (<em>Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage)</em>).</p>
      <p>In both cases, the tethers will always go on one tank, one healer,
      and two DPS.</p>
      <p>However, <em>Light Rampant</em> in E8S did not have the added
      requirement that two non-tethered players should be on the West and East 
      sides of the boss, which is why this method works there.</p>
      <p>In <em>Darklit Dragonsong</em>, that additional requirement means 
      resolving the tethers like E8S introduces an additional point of 
      failure into the mechanic.</p>
      <p>If each role lines up horizontally North and South, then if either
      D1+D2 or D3+D4 get tethered, D2 and D3 now need to swap sides, like in
      the example shown. This is a point of failure if either D2 or D3 do not 
      realise they need to swap.</p>
      <p>If each role lines up vertically East and West instead, we guarantee
      that exactly two players on each side are tethered, and two are not,
      making it easy for the four non-tethered players to move into position.</p>

  <b>[Darklit Dragonsong]</b> If the tethers make an hourglass, why rotate all 
  tethered players instead of just swapping two diagonally opposite players?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>The tethers do not lock in at the same time the towers resolve- there
      are four seconds in between.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you swap two diagonally opposite players, you risk snapping the
        tethers from being too short if either player is slow.</li>
        <li>By rotating the tethered players, the tethers stay stretched, so there 
        is more leeway if a player is slow, and the players still have a few 
        seconds to make it to their tower.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rotating clockwise also allows both tethered DPS to rotate into the 
      Oracle of Darkness, which is preferred since the Oracle of Darkness will 
      have more HP at the time, and we need to balance out the boss's HP for
      the upcoming <em>Morn Afah</em>.</p>

  <b>[Akh Morn]</b> Why 6:2 over 7:1?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The intuitive solution for <em>Akh Morn</em> is to stack the party in
      your standard 4:4 light parties.</p>
      <p>However, this deals considerable damage to the party. People quickly
      realised that although the party was rather soft to <em>Akh Morn</em>,
      one <em>Akh Morn</em> stack could be easily solo'ed by a tank with some 
      mitigation instead.</p>
      <p>This had the added benefit of having the other seven party members
      share the other <em>Akh Morn</em>, significantly lowering the damage
      compared to 4:4, so 7:1 quickly caught on.</p>
      <p>However, the problem with 7:1 is that if a tank dies to either
      <em>Darklit Dragonsong</em> or <em>Crystallize Time</em>, the remaining
      tank will have aggro on both bosses, and thus get both Light and Dark
      debuffs from the first <em>Akh Morn</em> hit and die, and now both
      <em>Akh Morns</em> target the party, quickly leading to a wipe.</p>
      <p><b>6:2 is the next evolution, and is a way around this problem.</b></p>
      <p>6:2 works because only the Usurpur of Frost autoattacks, while the
      Oracle of Darkness does not. Therefore, a tank <em>doesn't actually
      need</em> to hold aggro on the Oracle of Darkness.</p>
      <p>By having the tanks build hate on the Usurper of Frost at the start,
      then turning their tank stance <em>off</em> when the Oracle of Darkness
      appears, we ensure that the tanks never get hate on the Oracle of
      Darkness, so the <em>Akh Morn</em>s always go on a tank and a non-tank.</p>
      <p>Now, in the event a tank dies (particularly at <em>Crystallize
      Time</em>), the remaining tank only has aggro on the Usurper of Frost,
      and can continue to resolve <em>Akh Morn</em> with a 6:1 split instead.</p>

  <b>[Hallowed Wings]</b> Why do the anti-knockback strat instead of just
  doing it as intended?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Using <em>Arm's Length/Surecast</em> to mitigate the knockback from
      the first <em>Hallowed Wings</em> allows the party to record their
      positions closer to the center.</p>
      <p>This accomplishes three things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It lets the party not have to remember which side the first line
        AoE originated from.</li>
        <li>Where the party records their positions are a lot more lenient.</li>
        <li>The party can use their standard clock positions for <em>Spirit 
        Taker</em> (because they recorded near the center).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, there are drawbacks to this method- namely having to save
      party and tank mitigation, but groups that resolve <em>Hallowed
      Wings</em> the "intended" way already use mitigation to hedge against
      things going awry, so you may as well do the simpler strategy.</p>
