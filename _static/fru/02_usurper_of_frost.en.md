# Usurper of Frost

The tank that opens this fight should be the tank that did not invuln the
second *Powder Mark Trail* towards the end of P1 (which is usually the MT).

The boss opens the fight with *Quadruple Slap* on the tank. Despite the name, 
this is actually a "two-hit" tankbuster, but the first hit applies a *Physical 
Vulnerability Up* debuff that *can* be Esuna'ed.

Both hits can be invulned.

The boss will auto-attack twice after the tankbuster, and its damage is increased with the *Physical Vulnerability Up* debuff.

Either *Esuna* the *Physical Vulnerability Up*, mitigate through the two
auto-attacks, or have the ST *Provoke* the boss to take the auto-attacks.

The boss then teleports slightly south of center and casts *Mirror Image*
which summons an (untargetable) Oracle's Reflection before casting *Diamond
Dust* for heavy raid-wide damage.

## Diamond Dust - Colour-coded

*Diamond Dust* resolves itself in a very similar way to *Diamond Frost* in
Eden's Verse: Refulgence (Savage). We resolve this using the colour-coded
markers.

## Sunbound Holy - Mostly CW

The Oracle's Reflection then casts *Sunbound Holy*, which targets each healer 
four times with a 4-man stack AoE that also leaves a puddle behind. Each party 
needs to drop these puddles and end up **either directly behind the boss**, or 
**at least 135 degrees away from the boss**.

Because the Usurper of Frost teleports to a random cardinal/intercardinal 
position, we have four possible cases.

Essentially (with the exception of the first puddle), the party *cannot* drop
the puddles directly behind the Usurper of Frost.

      Morn</em> puddle behind the boss (as it will disappear), but not the
      second.</p>

      four puddles and still make it to the other side.</p>

The Usurper of Frost reappears back in the center of the arena and casts 
*Hallowed Ray* on the party (which is a heavy-hitting line stack) before 
starting the next set of mechanics.

## Mirror, Mirror

The Usurper of Frost will be targetable during this mechanic.

Two red mirrors and one blue mirror appear at the edge on any of the eight
cardinal/intercardinal positions.

- Blue mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, resolving at *the same
  time*.
- Red mirrors copy the Usurper of Frost's attack, but *resolves later*.

- The two red mirrors always spawn 90 degrees from one another.

After this, the boss will teleport to the middle and begin another signature 
mechanic.

## Light Rampant

Two players at random will be selected to drop AoE puddles, while the other six
will get tethered together *(Chains of Everlasting Light)*.

- After 10 seconds, the *Chains of Everlasting Light* debuff will turn into 
  *Curse of Everlasting Light*. From this point on, the raid wipes if the 
  tethers get too short.
- Two connected players will also have a 16 second *The Weight of Light*
  debuff. When the timer expires, this explodes with a 4-man stack.

There will also be six stacks of *Lightsteeped* randomly distributed among the 
party.

There are several ways to resolve *Light Rampant*. Essentially, the party needs
to decide two things:

1. How to resolve tethers.
2. How to drop puddles.

These are *largely* interchangeable with one another, so experiment to see what
works for your group.

The more important decision is how to deal with the tethers. In order of my
personal preference, they would be:

1. 4:4 - East adjust
2. MT-anchor ZizieZip
3. 4:4 - CW adjust

We have decided to follow the 4:4 East adjust method to resolve the tethers,
but are dropping puddles like ZizieZip's strat (but mirrored).

### Option 1 - "Overcooked" Light Rampant (4:4 East adjust)

This is what my static is doing.

It is the same tether strategy as Lily Doll's macro used in Mana, but we are
dropping the puddles like ZizieZip (but mirrored)- I like having the puddles
join the stack point from the front, rather than chase from behind.

### Option 2 - Light Rampant (MT-anchor ZizieZip)

This is a different method to assigning towers, which is equally viable. The 
party is more spaced out at the start, making it easier to identify the puddle 
players.

It's a minor variation of [ZizieZip's original strat](https://twitter.com/ZizieZip/status/1861483982157947303),
except that instead of counting from the two players with *The Weight of Light*
debuffs (as indicated by the glowing orbs on their head), you count your
position from a fixed player (the MT) instead.

### Option 3 - Light Rampant (4:4 CW)

This is a slight modification of the strat outlined in the Google Docs, and is
my least preferred solution by far- I *cannot* recommend this strat in good
faith.

The only change is to the DPS lineup- we use D1 D2 D3 D4 here, instead of D3 D4
D1 D2.

A few seconds later, the boss will start to cast *Absolute Zero*. This will
serve as the hard enrage, *unless* the boss is brought under 20.0% HP.

If the DPS check is met, *Absolute Zero* will be a raid-wide and a knockback
instead, so stay near the middle.

Once the four Crystals of Light have been destroyed (with all four Crystals of
Darkness alive), Gaia will exclaim, *"My power surges!"* and the Ice Veil will
lose its invulnerability.

If all the Crystals of Darkness are still alive, Gaia will gain enough power
and deal 50.0% damage to the Ice Veil just before *Endless Ice Age*
resolves. As a result, the damage check is to get the Ice Veil below 50.0% HP.

If all goes well, an ice necklace will briefly appear on the ground next to the
Usurper of Frost, which will be quickly absorbed.

Stack south to prepare for the next phase- the Usurper of Frost will do one
raid-wide (called *Junction*) and reveal herself to be Mitron before possessing
Gaia and turning her into the Oracle of Darkness.

<table>
  <tr>

<summary>
  <b>[Light Rampant (4:4 CW adjust)]</b> Why do I dislike 4:4 CW adjust so much?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Compared to 4:4 East adjust, 4:4 CW adjust overcomplicates the
      mechanic:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It requires players look at more things than is necessary.</li>
        <li>It makes 4-6 players adjust for something that can be resolved with
        just one player adjusting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider D2's position in the example on the right.</p>
      <p>With the 4:4 East adjust strat, the tower that D2 goes to is <em>fully
      determined</em> just by looking West along their row (i.e: D1). D2 sees
      there is no puddle on D1, therefore they are the second player in their
      row, and are therefore taking the North tower.</p>
      <p><b>This is <em>not</em> true for 4:4 CW adjust</b>, as both puddles
      <em>could</em> be on the tanks/healers, meaning D2 is now the
      <em>first</em> player in their row (after D1 rotates up), and they go to
      the South-West tower instead. As a result, each DPS needs to look at the
      <em>entire</em> DPS lineup instead of just looking to one side (and the
      same goes for the tanks/healers).</p>
      <p>As a result, compared to 4:4 East adjust, 4:4 CW adjust needs more
      information, and adds an extra layer (rotating 4-6 players) onto
      something that can just be resolved by just having the East-most player
      adjust instead (only one player adjusts).</p>
      <p>The fact that people were making macros containing <em>lookup
      tables</em> for 4:4 CW adjust just convinces me further that I simply
      <em>cannot</em> recommend 4:4 CW adjust as a strategy in good faith.</p>

  <b>[Light Rampant (4:4 East adjust)]</b> Why do we flip the DPS instead of
  the tanks/healers?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Believe it or not, this isn't done just to be different from the 4:4
      CW adjust strat. There are a couple practical reasons why.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flipping the DPS gives the healers the closer tower (North-West), so
        they have <em>slightly</em> more time to squeeze in any last-minute
        healing.</li>
        <li>Flipping the DPS also makes the tower diagram nicer, as counting 
        clockwise "reverses" the DPS as you would count them from their 
        right-to-left. The diagram on the right illustrates the tower numbers
        if you flipped the tanks/healers instead.</li>

  <b>[Light Rampant (4:4 East adjust)]</b> Is there a reason the puddles turn

<table>

      <p>This is done to accommodate D4, in particular, PCT.</p>
      <p>The PCT's possible towers with the 4:4 East adjust strat place them
      either NE or SW.</p>
      <p>Having the puddles turn right means that the <em>Weight of Light</em> 
      stacks are also NE or SW, keeping them close to the PCT's towers thus
      allowing them to paint their motifs to prepare for when the boss is

</summary>

      <p>For context, this is a problem specific to playing on a controller.</p>
      <p>Keyboards don't have this problem because pressing "W" moves your

      stick forward will not be perfect, so that slight deviation may be 
      enough to get you killed.</p>
      <p>Something that might help would be to set up a macro like so:</p>
      <pre>/automove on
/automove off</pre>
      <p>This will make your character take one tiny step directly forward 
      where your camera is facing.</p>

  <b>[Light Rampant]</b> How do you prevent the tethers from getting tangled?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Unfortunately, having tangled tethers is uncommon (less than 2/21 
      chance), and there is no way to guarantee that you will <em>never</em> 
      encounter tangled tethers due to the way <em>Light Rampant</em> issues
      the debuffs.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>First, pick two random players to get puddles.</li>
        <li>Then, pick a random player to start the tether chain.</li>
        <li>Connect that player to the closest player without either a puddle
        or a tether.</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step six times from the last connected player.
          <ul>
            <li>If there are fewer than six non-puddle players available, pick
            a puddle player last.</li>
            <li>If there are fewer than six players available, wipe the raid.</li>
          </ul>
        </li> 
      </ol>
      <p>Because of this, it is possible to get tangled patterns if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two puddle players are next to each other.</li>
        <li>The tether starts two players away from a puddle.</li>
        <li>The tether first connects towards a puddle.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the example on the right:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Both MT and ST are selected for puddles.</li>
        <li>H1 is randomly picked as the starting tether player.</li>
        <li>H1 tethers to the closest available player, which is H2 (moving 
        towards the puddles).</li>
        <li>H2 then tethers to the closest available player, which is D1 (not
        D4), and now you have a tangled tether.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If the tethers are tangled, then the tethers will criss-cross. Swap
      the two players around (H1 and H2 in this example) to untangle the
      tethers.</p>
