# Pandora

After the cutscene, Pandora quickly opens with her first mechanic.

## Fulgent Blade

The boss will cast *Fulgent Blade*, which starts with raid-wide damage. The 
boss will also autoattack during this sequence (before casting to cast *Akh 
Morn*).

Pandora's autoattacks hit the **top two** players with hate (which should be 
both tanks).

After the *Akh Morn*, Pandora goes straight into the next mechanic.

## Paradise Regained - Team DN

This is the most complex mechanic of the phase.

The strategy below closely resembles Team DN's method, which positions the first
tower completely safe from the first cleave, making it slightly more involved
for tanks, but simpler for the rest of the party.

The only difference is that instead of the melee and ranged take the last two
towers, we split the DPS left and right based on their left/right groups
instead.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>13.</b> Find the first tower. Use this tower as <b>South</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> Rotate to the new "North".</li>
        <li><b>H1, H2:</b> Preposition in the first tower.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" width="50%">
      <p><b>14.</b> The second tower appears.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the boss will cast <em>Wings Dark and Light</em>, and 
      one of the boss's wings will glow.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT + ST:</b> Tank swap during the <em>Wings Dark and Light</em> 
        cast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The MT goes top-left or top-right (around the same height as the
      second tower), depending on which wing glows first.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light (Left) wing glows:</b> MT goes top-right.</li>
        <li><b>Dark (Right) wing glows:</b> MT goes top-left.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A tether will also appear, which needs to go to the ST. It
      <em>cannot</em> be passed around, but instead automatically tethers to 
      either the nearest or furthest player <b>that is not the player with
      aggro</b> (depending on the wing).</p>
      <ul>

Have the MT *Provoke* to take the boss back, and face the boss to any of the
eight cardinal/intercardinal markers to prepare for the final mechanic of the
loop.

## Polarizing Strikes

This is the simplest mechanic of the phase, consisting of four rounds of stack 
damage.

    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>19.</b> Make two lines SW and SE with the tanks in front.</p>

      shortly.</p>
      <p>The player in front of each line (which should be the tanks) will also
      get a <em>Light Resistance Down</em> or a <em>Dark Resistance Down</em> 
      debuff (depending on which line hit them).</p>

After this, Pandora casts *Pandora's Box*, which is a Tank LB3 check.

From there, the mechanics repeat from *Fulgent Blade*. At the end of the second
loop, Pandora casts *Paradise Lost* for enrage instead of *Pandora's Box*.

Sometime during *Paradise Lost* (when the castbar reaches the "r" in
"Pa**r**adise"), Ryne will exclaim *"You can weather this! I know you can!"*
and give you 1.5 bars worth of Limit Break, which should reach an LB3. When
she does so, *immediately* LB3 (or it will not resolve before the enrage).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Fulgent Blade]</b> Why should the MT stay close to the inner corner of
  the diamond while dodging?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>This is done to orient the boss so that it is easy for the party to
      split for <em>Akh Morn</em>.</p>
      <p>The more the MT dodges to the side of the diamond where the exalines
      originated from (the area marked red), the more the boss is turned when
      it starts to cast <em>Akh Morn</em> and its orientation locked.</p>
      <p>The more the boss is turned, the harder it becomes for the party to

## Troubleshooting

<table>
  <tr>

      <p>Check how the MT is dodging the exalines.</p>
      <p>The more the MT dodges towards the side of the diamond where the

      <p>The more the boss is turned, the harder it is for the light party to

      <p>Take note of the boss's orientation in this diagram (indicated by the

      left and right groups.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> this is particularly pronounced when the MT dodges the 
      Exalines diagonally (see Step 7 above), because it encourages them to 
      dodge to that side of the diamond.</p>
      <p>This is why the MT should dodge to the <em>center first</em>, and 
      <em>then</em> dodge to the side for the second Exaline dodge.</p>
