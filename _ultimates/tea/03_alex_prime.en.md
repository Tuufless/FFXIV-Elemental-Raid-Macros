# Alexander Prime

After defeating Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser, the arena will change and
Alexander Prime appears alongside Brute Justice and Cruise Chaser to begin the
transition mechanic to this phase.

## Temporal Stasis

After *Temporal Stasis*, the **ST** will take aggro and invuln Alexander 
Prime's *Chastening Heat*. **This invuln should be timed** to also absorb the 
three *Divine Spear* cleaves that follow.

Alternatively, you can mitigate the *Chastening Heat*, and invuln the *Divine 
Spears* (there will be one auto-attack in between).

  <tr>
    <td><b>Chastening Heat + Divine Spears #1</b></td>
    <td><p>ST invuln.</p><p>Tank swap from ST to MT after the Divine Spears.</p></td>

After the *Divine Spears*, have the MT Provoke and take aggro. Alexander Prime 
will autoattack twice before casting *Inception Formation*.

Alexander Prime will then reappear in the center and begin another *Chastening 
Heat* → 3x *Divine Spear* combo on the MT. Handle this like before- either 
invuln all these attacks, or mitigate *Chastening Heat* and invuln the *Divine 
Spears*.

  Heat</em> is being cast (have the ST point the <em>Divine Spears</em> east).</p>
</div>

Alexander Prime then auto-attacks twice and casts *Wormhole Formation*.

## Wormhole Formation

Wormhole Formation will use 09STOP's method (highlighted by the [Korean simulator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sdo02A5GbNPA9B4HN-NOt-vnTPyv2elH/view)).

Remember that **all odd numbered players must face outside the arena and use 
Arm's Length/Surecast** when baiting Cruise Chaser to nullify the knockback 
from *Alpha Sword*.

### Pair-wise movement

Broken down into the major steps, here's what each pair does. Note that what 
each pair does is **independent from the rest of the party**, so you can focus 
on executing your part.

All the action happens north and south. If it's not your turn to do anything, 
or if you're done, return to the East/West positions.

After the *Enumeration* at the end of *Wormhole Formation*, Alexander Prime 
will respawn back in the center of the arena and cast two *Mega Holies* 
back-to-back.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mega Holy x2</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>MT Reprisal, D1, D4</p>
      <p><em>(If timed correctly, Reprisal, Feint, and Addle will cover 
      <b>both</b> Mega Holies)</em>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After the two *Mega Holies*, Alexander Prime will then cast *Summon Alexander* 
before disappearing.

---

## J Waves

All three bosses will reappear, with Brute Justice landing with a *J Storm*.

- Cruise Chaser and Alexander Prime will immediately start casting their 
  enrages.
- Brute Justice will hit the party with periodic *J Wave* raid damage roughly 
  each GCD.
- Each *J Wave* also gives Brute Justice a damage-up stack (max 16).

The party will need to (in order):

1. Defeat Cruise Chaser. *(Cruise Chaser's enrage finishes before Brute 
   Justice's 8th stack.)*
2. Defeat Brute Justice. *(This will allow the party to damage Alexander 
   Prime.)*
3. Defeat Alexander Prime. *(Alexander Prime is invulnerable while BJCC are 
   still around. If you have time, build gauge to prepare for the reopener at 
   Perfect Alexander.)*

As *J Waves* hit progressively harder, you will need to plan party mitigations 
accordingly:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 6 stacks:</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>MT 90s, ST 90s, H1 120s, H2 120s</p>
      <p><em>(This should be around the time Cruise Chaser dies.)</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 8 stacks:</b></td>
    <td><p>ST Reprisal, H2 30s, D2, D3</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>After 10 stacks:</b></td>
    <td>Any remaining mitigations</td>
  </tr>

When Alexander Prime is defeated, a countdown to *Divine Judgment* will begin. 
If Alexander did not enrage, this will be survivable with a Tank LB3 and 
mitigations.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Divine Judgment</b></td>
    <td>
      <p>Tank LB3, H2 shields, H2 30s</p>
      <p><em>(Tank LB3 when the countdown reaches ~4 seconds.)</em>.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>

The party then proceeds onto Perfect Alexander.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<summary>
  <b>[Temporal Stasis]</b> Why does the blue-tethered player on Cruise 
  Chaser's side have to take a few steps towards Cruise Chaser?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Cruise Chaser cleaves the three closest players to it.</p>
      <p>If the player with the blue tether on Cruise Chaser's side goes all
      the way to the arena's edge, the three closest players to Cruise Chaser 
      now become:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two players just north and south of Cruise Chaser.</li>
        <li><b>One of the players at Brute Justice</b> instead of the player 
        with the blue tether.</li>
      </ul>

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Criss-crossing the tethers prevents the green orbs (particularly the

<summary>
  <b>[Inception]</b> Why do we place the crystals in a square?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The crystals need to be placed in a way such that the True Heart that 
      spawns opposite Alexander hits all four crystals. Then will turn the 
      True Heart gold and give the party the Enigma Codex buff.</p>
      <p>The Enigma Codex buff is necessary in order to clear Perfect 
      Alexander.</p>
      <p>When the True Heart hits a crystal, it deals proximity damage to all 
      players. As a result, we want to place them as far away from the party 
      as we can.</p>

</summary>
<table>
  <tr>

      {% include youtube.html id="VG2M2bozu2M" %}
      <p>That group super-shielded Divine Judgment to the point where they 
      didn't need to Tank LB3, which let them cheese Fate Calibration α with a 
      Healer LB3 instead.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the group abused a timing issue with the forced 
      march in Fate Calibration β, where if a player jumped and was mid-air 
      when the mechanic starts, the forced movement time would continue to 
      tick, but the player would not be able to move while they are mid-air and
      not be marched out of the arena as a result.</p>

      fixed this by adding a delay from when players lose control of their 
      character, to when the forced march starts. Now, if you try to jump, this 
      delay will cause the forced march to begin only after your character 
      lands, and you will march the full distance out of the arena.</p>

  <summary><b>[Wormhole Formation]</b> Can either 3 or 4 take the final

<table>
  <tr>

      <p>Cruise Chaser's <em>Alpha Sword</em> applies a <em>Magic Vulnerability

      <p><b>However</b>, although the vulnerability increases damage taken by

  <b>[Enumeration]</b> Why don't we group both tanks with one <em>Enumeration</em>
  target, and both healers with the other <em>Enumeration</em> target?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Let's call the earlier BJCC strat the "melee-swap" and the proposed 
      alternative "TTD/HHD".</p>
      <p>With each strat, the party splits up as follows after <em>Incinerating Heat</em>:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align:center"><b>Melee-swap</b></td>
          <td style="text-align:center"><b>TTD/HHD</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align:center">MTST out, H1D1D3 west, H2D2D4 east</td>
          <td style="text-align:center">MTSTD1D2 west, H1H2D3D4 east</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The problem with <em>Enumeration</em> largely stems from two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The party is tightly stacked together for <em>Incinerating Heat</em></li>
        <li>The only way to see who is targeted with <em>Enumeration</em> is 
        to look at the characters- there is no debuff icon on the party list.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Although the TTD/HHD strat looks simple, there are a few steps 
      involved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All DPS need to identify whether they are an <em>Enumeration</em> 
        target.</li>
        <li>The two (random) <em>Enumeration</em> targets need to figure out 
        their priority between themselves (one west, one east).</li>
        <li>The two (random) non-<em>Enumeration</em> DPS then need to move 
        out of the way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By keeping the same melee-swap Enumeration strat from BJCC, we:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain consistency between both phases.</li>
        <li>Fix who stays out of the <em>Enumerations</em> (the tanks are 
        <em>never</em> in <em>Enumeration</em>).</li>
        <li>Only two DPS need to pay attention and adjust (D1 and D2) instead 
        of all four.</li>
        <li>There is just a cue to swap (both <em>Enumerations</em> on one 
        side), instead of following a priority system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To elaborate further, consider what happens when the party splits 
      right after <em>Incinerating Heat</em> to resolve <em>Enumeration</em>. 
      Assuming the DPS split up 2-2, there are two possible outcomes:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td></td>
          <td style="text-align:center"><b>Melee-swap</b></td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>

            <p><em>(2/3 cases)</em></p>

          <td><em>Enumeration</em> is trivially solved (each group already has 
          three members.)</td>
          <td>
            <p>Each group has four members.</p>
            <p>The two DPS on each side need to determine which one of them 
            does not have <em>Enumeration</em> and leave the group (two 
            players move, but all four DPS potentially have to move).</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><b>Both Enumerations are on the same side</b></p>
            <p><em>(1/3 cases)</em></p>
          </td>
          <td>D1 and D2 swap groups (two players move).</td>
          <td>
            <p>One DPS from the side with two <em>Enumerations</em> has to 
            swap to the other side (presumably D2 or D3).</p>
            <p>Both DPS from the side with no <em>Enumerations</em> has to 
            leave the group (three players move, but all four DPS potentially 
            have to move.)</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Without knowing what the Enumeration split will be ahead of time, 
      only two players potentially have to adjust with the melee-swap strat 1/3 
      of the time, while at least two DPS are guaranteed to adjust (with all 
      four DPS potentially having to adjust) with the TTD/HHD strat <em>all</em>
      the time, leading to more points of error.</p>
      <p>The melee-swap strat also establishes exactly <em>who</em> adjusts in
      the event the Enumerations do not start out balanced, reducing the number
      of players that potentially have to adjust from four to two.</p>
      <p>This also means that if you are D1 or D2, and you have four people on
      your side, you are the one that needs to swap to the other side <em>
      (because your counterpart has already swapped, but you haven't)</em>.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is quite common while learning the strat, and is the technical 
      part of executing the strat.</p>
      <p>First off, check that the people that are taking the Void puddles
      aren't moving too close to the center of the arena, since that would 
      obviously put them in the <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em>'s AoE.</p>
      <p>More likely, either Player 3 or Player 4 (whoever wasn't baiting 
      <em>Super Jump</em>) gets killed by an <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em>, in 
      which case check the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Was the <em>Super Jump</em> baited in front of the red dot?</li>
        <li>Was the player not baiting <em>Super Jump</em> all the way at the 
        edge of the arena?</li>
        <li>Did the player responsible for baiting <em>Apocalyptic Ray</em> 
        (either Player 1 or Player 2) move out of position early? <em>(This 
        will tilt the Apocalyptic Ray slightly, enough to kill the other 
        player- see the diagram.)</em></li>
