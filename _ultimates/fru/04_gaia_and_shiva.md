# Gaia and Shiva（2体フェーズ）

Mana PF follows Nukemaru's strat for this phase onwards.

{% include youtube.html id="nX2kfaMnCiU" %}

The Usurper of Frost will respawn at either North or South, whichever is
further from where The Oracle of Darkness was defeated.

**Make sure the two tanks have first and second aggro on the Usurper of
Frost**- her auto-attacks hit the top *two* players in aggro.

### Fragment of Fate

The Usurper of Frost casts *Materialization*, which spawns the Fragment of Fate
North.

Over the course of the phase, the Fragment of Fate will take damage. Assuming
no player hits it with an AoE, it will survive with barely any HP.

This means that if it takes *any* extra damage (from an enemy AoE that targets 
a player), the phase becomes impossible to clear (although you'll still be able
to get practice in.)

      Frost spawned.</p>

      each player was standing. Simply move away when the boss transforms.</p>

</table>

The Oracle of Darkness then respawns (everyone should swap over to target her),
and should be taken by the ST.

They will shortly begin their first joint mechanic.

## Darklit Dragonsong（光と闇の竜詩）

Both bosses will cast *Darklit Dragonsong*.

- The Usurper of Frost will deal raidwide damage.
- The Oracle of Darkness will apply tethers and *Dark Water III* debuffs on the
  party.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>4.</b> Line up with healers and tanks along the North, and DPS
      along the South.</p>
      <p>Two sets of debuffs come out:</p>

        tethers.</li>
        <li>Two random players get <em>Dark Water III</em>.</li>

To resolve the tethers, we have to make a "bowtie" shape- this is the same as
how *Light Rampant* was solved in *Eden's Verse- Refulgence*.

To summarise, the tethered healer will always go North. For everybody else:

- **If you are tethered to a healer:** Go south.
- **If you are tethered, but not to a healer:** Go north.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>5.</b> This is the best case scenario, where the tethers already
      make a bowtie.</p>
      <p>No adjustments are needed- the north-most tether players go to the
      North tower, and the south-most tether players go to the South tower.</p>

    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru_mana/04/darklit_03a.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

With the tethers sorted out, the next thing we need to do is separate the two
*Dark Water III* debuffs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>7.</b> If the two <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are on different 
      sides (North vs. South), then no further adjustments need to be made.</p>
      <p>If the <em>Dark Water III</em> debuffs are either both North, or both
      South, then the Water player and their partner swap sides.</p>
      <p>Do this <b>before the towers resolve</b>.</p>
      <p><em>(In this example, since both Water debuffs are in the North group,
      the non-tether Water (H2) and their partner (D3) switch places.)</em></p>

    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru_mana/04/darklit_03b.jpg">

## Akh Morn 1 - 7:1 (MT solo)

The two bosses will then teleport a bit West and East of the center for *Akh
Morn* into *Morn Afah*, which is a party stack.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>13.</b> The two bosses target whoever has their hate with a 4-hit
      <em>Akh Morn</em> (which should be their respective tanks).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Done this way, each <em>Akh Morn</em> hit deals roughly 175k damage 
        to the solo tank.</li>
        <li><b>Note:</b> The solo tank <em>cannot</em> use their 40% mitigation,
        as they will need it for <em>Crystallize Time</em>. Use co-tank
        and targeted healer mitigations to help.</li>
      </ul>

  </tr>
</table>

*Morn Afah* is also a boss HP check, and the two bosses must be within 5% HP of
each other, or *Morn Afah* will be lethal. If they are not within 5% HP, the
two bosses will tether together indicating which boss has too much HP.

- **White tether:** The Usurper of Frost has too much HP.
- **Purple tether:** The Oracle of Darkness has too much HP.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> <em>Morn Afah</em> originates from the Usurper of Frost, not
  the Oracle of Darkness.</p>
  <p>If the HP difference is too large (i.e: the bosses are tethered together),
  the MT (that's holding the Usurper of Frost) can sacrifice themselves to save
  the party from wiping to <em>Morn Afah</em>.</p>
</div>

## Crystallize Time（時間結晶）

The bosses will cast *Crystallize Time*. This is probably the hardest part of
the encounter, so hang in there.

- Six hourglasses will spawn.
- The Usurper of Frost will apply a set of debuffs on the players to resolve.
- The Oracle of Darkness will deal raidwide damage and tether to four
  hourglasses.
  - The North and South hourglasses with yellow tethers.
  - Two of the remaining opposite hourglasses with purple tethers.

## Akh Morn 2 - 7:1 (ST solo)

The two bosses will reappear around the center of the arena and immediately 
start another 4-hit *Akh Morn* into *Morn Afah* sequence.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>27.</b> The two bosses target whoever has their hate with a 4-hit
      <em>Akh Morn</em> (which should be their respective tanks).</p>
      <p>This time, we have the ST split off and take it solo.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/fru_mana/04/akh_morn_02.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Notably, the Fragment of Fate will do one round of *Edge of Oblivion* just
before the *Morn Afah* resolves, so any shields will need to be reapplied.

Also remember that two bosses have to be within 5% HP of each other for *Morn
Afah*. If things are looking bad, *Morn Afah* comes from the Usurper of Frost,
so the MT can sacrifice themselves and take it away from the party if needed.

Both bosses will then start casting their respective enrages (*Absolute Zero*
and *Memory's End*).

When both bosses are defeated, there will be a knockback from the center, and 
you will advance to the next arena.

If the Fragment of Fate is not around, Eden's Promise will spawn and wipe the
raid. If, on the other hand, the Fragment of Fate is still alive, then the
party advances to the final phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Materialization]</b> Does the Fragment of Fate still spawn if the
  Crystals of Darkness were destroyed earlier?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>Materialization</em> will always spawn a Fragment of Fate,
      regardless of whether the Crystals of Darkness were destroyed.</p>
      <p>However, if the Crystals of Darkness are destroyed, the memory will be
      changed and the name of the raidwide that it periodically casts is named
      <em>Depths of Oblivion</em> instead of <em>Edge of Oblivion</em>. They
      both do the same amount of damage.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Crystallize Time]</b> Why do the anti-knockback strat instead of just
  doing it normally?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Using <em>Arm's Length/Surecast</em> to mitigate the knockback from
      the first <em>Hallowed Wings</em> allows the party to record their
      positions closer to the center.</p>
      <p>This accomplishes two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It gives more time for the blue <em>Wyrmfang</em> players to pick
        up their puddles, because they don't have to travel as far to join the
        party to record.</li>
        <li>It lets the party spread use their standard clock positions for
        <em>Spirit Taker</em> (because they recorded near the center).</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Crystallize Time (Hallowed Wings)]</b> Just <em>how</em> does this mechanic work?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>As mentioned, the first player hit takes the most damage, and that
      damage goes down the further down the line you go.</p>
      <p>More specifically, the base damage numbers are approximately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st player: ~160k damage</li>
        <li>2nd player: ~70k damage</li>
        <li>3rd player: ~55k damage</li>
        <li>4th player: ~55k damage</li>
        <li>5th player: ~40k damage</li>
        <li>6th player: ~15k damage</li>
        <li>7th player: ~10k damage</li>
        <li>8th player: ~10k damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, the first four players hit also get a <em>Magic 
      Vulnerability Up</em> debuff. This debuff increases the damage taken to
      400%, which means that the fifth player hit with vuln (400% x ~40k
      damage) takes roughly the same damage as the first player without (~160k
      damage).</p>
      <p>Note that these are <em>base</em> values, so multiply them roughly by
      0.64 for tanks, and 0.94 for casters/healers.</p>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Somber Dance]</b> How did the WAR die? What went wrong with
  <em>Holmgang</em>?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>Holmgang</em> has two modes- one that has a target, and one that
      does not.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If no target is selected, then the WAR can simply press
        <em>Holmgang</em> and have it resolve.</li>
        <li>However, <b>if a target is selected</b>, and the WAR more than 6.5
        yalms away, the target is out of range of <em>Holmgang</em>, and
        <b><em>Holmgang</em> will not go off.</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is especially a problem for WAR, because they need to bait Somber
      Dance far (i.e: further than 6.5 yalms), and are likely targeting
      <em>something</em>.</p>
      <p>The solution is to simply untarget before pressing <em>Holmgang</em>.</p>
