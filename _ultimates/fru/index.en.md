# Futures Rewritten (Ultimate)

I've been PF'ing FRU in Mana, and this goes over the Mana PF strat.

Mana does the [new Lily Doll strat](https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/34120564/blog/5500375/),
which is basically Lily Doll's original strat, but has P4 and P5 replaced with
Nukemaru's strats.

### BiS Notes

- Use your **i730** BiS.
- Use the highest grade potions available.

Looking towards the future:

- Futures Rewritten will not be outgeared until **i860** gear is available in
Patch 8.0.
- Relic weapons (when they arrive) will have their substats capped at **393**.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Damage Down]</b> How strong is the damage down debuff in this fight?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>There are actually <em>two</em> different Damage Down debuffs in this 
      encounter, both of which lowers a player's damage by <b>90%</b>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Damage Down</em> comes from getting hit by avoidable attacks.</li>
        <li><em>Mark of Mortality</em> comes from resolving stacks with less 
        than the required number of players.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These damage downs also come from two separate debuffs, so <em>they
      stack</em> together for a combined <b>99% damage down!</b></p>
