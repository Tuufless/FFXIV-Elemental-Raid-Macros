# Bahamut Prime

Bahamut's phase is a gauntlet of "Trio" mechanics (which is where the term 
comes from).

Trios are essentially a mechanics dance, involving mechanics from each of the 
three bosses (Twintania, Nael, Bahamut) executed together.

---

## Quickmarch Trio

Bahamut opens with a Flare Breath into Flatten (and an auto-attack) before 
starting the first of many Trios.

      <p>Note the gap between the middle positions and the top and bottom. It 
      may be difficult for the tanks (and especially) the ranged to judge the 
      boundary of the dive. They don't need to be right up against the dive-
      the healers and melee just need enough space to dodge along the edge.</p>

## Fellruin Trio

After Blackfire Trio, Bahamut Flare Breaths three times, before starting 
Fellruin Trio.

The two possible quotes Nael will use are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>moon</b> and <b>stars</b> to 
    bring!</td>
    <td>
      <p>Raven's Dive → Lunar Dynamo → Meteor Stream</p>
      <p><em>Spread → In → (Neurolinks) → Spread</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>From <b>hallowed moon</b> I <b>descend</b>, a rain of <b>stars</b> to 
    bring!</td>

      <p>Lunar Dynamo → Raven's Dive → Meteor Stream</p>
      <p><em>In → Spread → (Neurolinks) → Spread</em></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that Nael's lines now telegraph *three* mechanics instead of two.

## Heavensfall Trio

After Blackfire Trio, Bahamut *immediately* turns to Flare Breath the tank, 
before doing Flatten into Flare Breath.

Bahamut then starts Heavensfall Trio, marking the halfway point in the fight.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Stack center, and locate the three bosses.</p>
      <p>One player will get marked for Bahamut's dive, while another player 
      will get marked for Twintania's dive.</p>

    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/ucob/03/heavensfall_01.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> Spread out as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT, ST:</b> Towards Nael.</li>
        <li><b>H1, D1:</b> To the left of the three bosses.</li>
        <li><b>H2, D2:</b> To the right of the three bosses.</li>

## Grand Octet (with Tank LB)

After Tenstrike, Bahamut Flattens and Flare Breaths before starting *Grand 
Octet*.

Bahamut must be **below 60% HP** by the time it disappears for *Grand Octet*, 
or it will gain a damage-up buff in Golden Bahamut (roughly 5x damage), making
it impossible to clear the fight with a standard party (although you will still
be able to prog the adds phase).

*(This should* really *not be a problem nowadays.)*

### Grand Octet (without Tank LB3)

If you don't have tank LB3, then Grand Octet becomes significantly harder.

Everything stays the same for the last part, except player roles are now fixed.

- The Twintania player still goes to Twintania's left.
- **Megaflare players stack on Twintania's right.**
- **Non-Megaflare players take towers.**

However, the Twintania player may be part of the Megaflare group, or the towers 
(non-Megaflare) group.

      <p><b>If the Twintania player does not have Megaflare</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The other three players without Megaflare markers take three of the 
        four towers, <b>leaving the nearest tower to Twintania empty</b>.</li>
        <li>The four players with Megaflare loosely stack together on 
        Twintania's right.</li>

      the empty tower.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Quickmarch Trio]</b> Why do we dodge Twisters by moving along the edge?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Dodging Twisters this way accomplishes two things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeps the party somewhat spread out to avoid overlapping the
        (untelegraphed) Megaflare AoEs.</li>
        <li>Keeps the area around the center of the arena clear from the large
        (telegraphed) Megaflare AoEs, so the healers have a clear path to move
        towards the center to AoE heal the DPS stack.</li>
