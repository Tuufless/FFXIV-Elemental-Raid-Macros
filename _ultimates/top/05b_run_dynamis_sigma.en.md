# Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version)

Run: Dynamis (Sigma Version) can be broken down into three parts:

1. [Wave Cannons and Lasers](#1-wave-cannons-and-lasers)
2. [Mid/Remote Glitch and knockback towers](#2-knockback-towers)
3. [Hello, World](#3-hello-world-sigma)

## 1. Wave Cannons and Lasers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1.</b> Two arms will spawn followed by Omega-M.</p>
      <p>The arms will always spawn SW and SE relative to Omega-M, who will
      serve as "north" for this part.</p>

## 2. Knockback Towers

The next step are the towers with Mid/Remote Glitch.

There are several strategies to deal with this, but we have chosen to go with a
strategy that assigns players to towers based on the waymarks they were
standing at at the end of the previous section.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>5.</b> Towers will spawn along the edge of the arena.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If players have <b>Remote Glitch</b>, five towers will spawn.</li>
        <li>If players have <b>Mid Glitch</b>, six towers will spawn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The towers will spawn in a fixed formation, oriented either to where
      Omega-M was standing before, or directly opposite.</p>
      <p><b>Identify your tower based on the waymark you were standing 
      beside at the end of the previous section.</b></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_05b.jpg">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_05a.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <p><b>7.</b> Move towards the center, and position yourself in front of
      your tower.</p>
      <p>Omega-F then appears in the center of the arena, and knocks all
      players back towards the edge.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mid Glitch:</b> Stand in the <b>center</b> of the towers.</li>
        <li><b>Remote Glitch: Criss-cross the tethers</b>, and stand at the
        <b>edge</b> of the towers.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## 3. Hello, World (Sigma)

From here, we finally reach the last part of Run, Dynamis: Sigma which is the
part where we resolve Hello, World.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>7.</b> Omega-F will spawn at any cardinal or intercardinal
      position, with two Right Arm Units opposite, and Omega's Rear Power Unit
      in the center.</p>
      <p>Use Omega-F as North, and note whether Omega-F is in her blade-legs
      stance or not.</p>
      <p>Identify three players to go to Omega-F with the following priority:</p>
      <p style="text-align:center">
        <b>Omega-F:</b> H1 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 H2 <b>:Opposite</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>At least two of these players must have one stack of Dynamis each.</li>
        <li>None of these players can have a Hello, World debuff.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The remaining five players go opposite Omega-F.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>8.</b> The Rear Power Unit will start firing a straight-line AoE
      while slowly rotating.</p>
      <p>Depending on whether Omega-F has her blade-legs or not, either wait
      and stay outside <b>or</b> follow the Rear Power Unit's AoE.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_08b.jpg">
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_08a.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>9.</b> After rotating and firing fourteen times, the Rear Power
      Unit will fire its last laser in this orientation.</p>
      <p>Use this time to move into position to resolve Hello, World.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_09.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>10.</b> Hello, World debuffs resolve along with the Right Arm
      Unit's lasers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The two players with <em>Hello, Near World</em> and <em>Hello,
        Distant World</em> should be <b>one ring in front of the markers</b>
        <em>(towards the center of the arena)</em></li>
        <li>The first player receiving <em>Hello, Near World</em> should
        <b>stop at the (inter)cardinal mark</b> at the edge of the arena, with
        the second player <b>four notches behind</b>.</li>
        <li>If there are any tanks with one stack of Dynamis that started by
        Omega-F, they would ideally bait the Arm lasers.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/ultimates/top/05b/run_dynamis_sigma_10.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Done correctly, at this point the party should have four players with one stack
of Dynamis, and four players with two stacks of Dynamis.

### Sigma Automarkers

It is common practice in Elemental DC to use Automarkers to assign player
positions to resolve *Hello, Near World* and *Hello, Distant World*.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>This would be the configuration typically used.</p>
      <p>The players marked "1" would typically follow the rotating laser,
      although it is common practice for the two players baiting the arms to
      incidate which direction they want to go before the laser starts
      spinning.</p>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Hello, World (Sigma)]</b> Why the HTDH priority, and why should tanks
  take the Arm lasers if possible?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The goal is to avoid a scenario where tanks are the ones taking Beetle
      Omega's tethers during the last set of Hello, Worlds in Run: Dynamis
      (Omega Version).</p>
      <p>This is because if a tank ends up taking a tether, the Max HP debuff
      will wear off, and the tank will need to be topped up for the last set of
      Solar Ray tankbusters. While doable, it is rather annoying to deal with.</p>
      <p>To ensure a tank will not take a tether at the end of Omega, that
      player must enter Omega with just one stack of Dynamis, which means they
      must miss <em>either</em> the Dynamis stack from Delta, <em>or</em> the
      Dynamis stack from Sigma.</p>
      <p>If a tank is going to Omega-F, that implies that they <em>already</em>
      have a Dynamis stack from Delta, so we want them to miss getting a
      Dynamis stack from Sigma (baiting the Arm lasers) to guarantee they will
      not take the tethers at the end of Omega.</p>
      <p>While you cannot <em>guarantee</em> that a tank will <em>never</em>
      take the tethers (since a tank can be extremely unlucky and be assigned
      three Hello, World debuffs), this at least greatly reduces the chance of
      that happening.</p>
