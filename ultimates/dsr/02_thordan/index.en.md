# King Thordan

This is the "real" start of the fight, and the encounter will restart from this
point in the event of a wipe.

Thordan opens with two auto-attacks. Each auto-attack is a small cleave, so
Thordan should be pointed away from the party.

- Thordan will cast *Ascalon's Mercy Concealed*- this will fire a lethal cone
  AoE at each player. All players (except the MT) stack behind Thordan to bait
  these, and dodge to the side when the cast finishes.
- Thordan will then target the MT with three *Ascalon's Might* (large cleaves)
  before starting the first major mechanic.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<b>Tip:</b> A WAR can Holmgang this first set of <em>Ascalon's Might</em> and
have Holmgang back up in time.</div>

Note that players on the back row can simply run forward to naturally dodge the
Heavy Impacts as long as Ser Guerrique is not on one of the three closer positions.

- [Nearest Heavy Impact](https://clips.twitch.tv/RelatedPiercingGrasshopperOMGScoots-iqC09dukfOnorski)

As you are dodging the Heavy Impact, locate the two knights towards the center
of the arena.

These knights indicate the orientation of the map for the next part of Strength
of the Ward, and will always spawn "southwest" and "southeast".

![](images/strength_orientation.jpg)

Thordan will do another Ascalon's Mercy Concealed that locks on each player's
position at the fourth Heavy Impact.

Dodge the Ascalon's Mercy Concealed, and orientate yourself to the new "North"
as indicated by the two knights.

### Part 2

After dodging the Heavy Impact and Ascalon's Mercy Concealed, orientate
yourself such that Thordan is north.

- Thordan will reappear in the middle of the arena and begin to cast *Ancient Quaga*.
- After the *Ancient Quaga*, Thordan will do another *Heavenly Heel* (tank
  swap), followed by 3x *Ascalon's Might*.

Thordan will then cast *Sanctity of the Ward*.

---

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Part 1: Sacred Severs

We resolve Sacred Severs with a **DRK-relative, role-adjust** strat.

- MT, H1, D1, D3 takes Group 1 as its base position, **opposite** the DRK.
- ST, H2, D2, D4 takes Group 2 as its base position, on the **same side** as
  the DRK.

Two random players will be assigned "1" and "2", indicated by the number of
swords above their head. This forces them to join that group.

If a player in a group receives the wrong numbered sword from their group (e.g:
D3 receives the "2" sword), then the **corresponding role** in the other group
(D4) swaps groups with that person.

In other words:

1. If **you have a sword** above your head, **move to that group.**
2. Otherwise, if your **role-partner has your group's sword, swap groups.**

After Sanctity of the Ward, Thordan reappears North and begins casting
*Ultimate End* (which does not have a visible castbar). This is very-heavy
raid-wide damage that needs to be mitigated.

Thordan will flail around, doing two sets of *Broad Swings*. Each
*Broad Swing* requires the party to dodge from behind Thordan to either his
front-left or front-right, depending on which he cleaves first.

After both sets are complete, Thordan will cast *Aetheric Burst*, which
serves as the hard enrage for this phase.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<summary>
  <b>[Strength of the Ward]</b> Why are the healers in front?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Putting the healers in front lets them get to the middle quickly
  and start casting a GCD heal (hitting both light parties) <em>before</em>
  having to dodge the Ascalon's Mercy Concealed and <em>without</em> using

  <b>[Sanctity of the Ward]</b> Any tips for cursed towers?

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Because there will be at least five towers on the outside, there will
      <em>always</em> be a non-cursed pair of positions.</p>
      <p>The problem is that this pair of positions isn't necessarily North and
      South. If you have voice comms, you can try to communicate that the
      Meteor pairs should go East and West instead, although this is rarely
      done.</p>
      <p>There are 90 notches around the arena. Assuming you have the cursed
      (120 degrees) tower pattern, you have 30 notches to put seven gaps
      between Meteors, which amounts to just over <b>four notches each</b>.</p>
