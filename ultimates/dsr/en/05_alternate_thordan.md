<summary><b>[Thordan]</b> What happens if you kill Thordan in this phase?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>At the end of the next phase with Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr, Nidhogg's eyes threaten to take over Estinien again.</p><p>If Thordan was spared at the end of this phase, this is where Thordan jumps in to take the eyes and become Dragonking Thordan.</p><p>However, if you kill Thordan in this alternate timeline, Thordan isn't around to take the eyes and the party returns to a repeat of the Eyes phase except this time, Haurchefant isn't dead and the party is now missing Huarchefant's buff needed to damage the blue eye.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">もしも最後のトールダンを生かさず倒したらルート <a href="https://t.co/KSCL1DuGH7">pic.twitter.com/KSCL1DuGH7</a></p>&mdash; たかぱすと (@takapast) <a href="https://twitter.com/takapast/status/1522008634158649345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></td></tr>
