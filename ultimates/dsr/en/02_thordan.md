# King Thordan

## Summary

If you are already familiar with Thordan, and just need a quick summary:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Strength of the Ward</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>Crossed tethers</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><b>Sanctity of the Ward</b></td>
    <td><ul><li>DRK-relative, role swap</li><li>Meteor-roles out, center > ccw > cw</li></ul></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Strength of the Ward

### Part 1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Light party spreads.</p><p>Healers are in front to allow them to dodge into the upcoming Heavy Impact early. This then lets them cast an additional GCD heal without using Swiftcast.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/strength_of_the_ward_1_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Heavy Impact boundaries.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/strength_of_the_ward_1_2.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that players on the back row can simply run forward to naturally dodge the Heavy Impacts as long as Ser Guerrique is not on one of the three closer positions.

- [Nearest Heavy Impact](https://clips.twitch.tv/RelatedPiercingGrasshopperOMGScoots-iqC09dukfOnorski)

### Part 2

After dodging the Heavy Impact and Ascalon's Mercy Concealed, orientate yourself such that Thordan is north.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Using Thordan as north:</p><ul><li>Three (non-tanks) will be targeted with blue Skyward Leap markers. These players go west, east, and south.</li><li>The other three (non-tanks) go north towards Thordan and loosely spread to communicate tower positions before stacking in front of the "shuriken" mark.</li><li>The two tanks take tethers, and criss-cross them.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/thordan/strength_of_the_ward_2_1.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Tips:**
- Do not look for Thordan. Instead, look for the two (of three) knights that spawn closest to the center.
  - Thordan appears at his position last, giving you the least amount of time to find him.
  - The two knights will spawn while the Heavy Impacts are resolving (and Thordan is still in the center).
  - The two knights will always spawn SW and SE relative to where Thordan will teleport to later.
- Have the tanks stand halfway in between and let the party members bring the tethers to them.
  - Tanks have probably been trained to stand right next to the knights (the tether sources) to pick up the tethers. However, if you do this, there isn't enough time to make it to the edge (without Sprint).
- The two blue prey targets east and west should stand one notch away from the party to avoid hitting the tanks with the AoE (and giving them a debuff that will kill them).

## Sanctity of the Ward

### Part 1: Sacred Severs

Currently, the most popular way to resolve Sacred Severs is a **DRK-relative, role-adjust** strat.

- The MT group takes Group 1 as its base position, away from the DRK.
- The ST group takes Group 2 as its base position, on the same side as the DRK.

If a player in a group receives the wrong numbered sword (e.g: D3 receives the "2" sword), then the corresponding role in the other group (D4) swaps groups with that person.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>1.</b> Sort out swords, and start 3-4 notches away from the outside "shurikens" <b>in the same direction that the inside knights are facing</b>.</td>

  </tr>

    <td>
      <p><b>2.</b> Your movement will also be in the <b>same direction</b> that the inside knights faced.</p>
      <p>Wait for the explosion in front of you to go off first before moving.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are moving <b>towards</b> the N/S poles, you have the <b>fast/early</b> dodge (example on the left).</li>
        <li>If you are moving <b>away</b> from the N/S poles, you have the <b>slow/delayed</b> dodge (example on the right).</li>
