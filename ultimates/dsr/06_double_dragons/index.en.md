# Double Dragons

## Summary

If you are already familiar with the Double Dragons phase, and just need a quick summary:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Wyrmsbreath #1</b></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>△, D1 D2 D3 adjusts</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Mortal Vow</b></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>DPS → MT → ST → D1/D2 → D3</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Wroth Flames</b></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Spreads to Nidhogg (west)</li>
        <li>Stacks to Hraesvelgr (east)</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Wyrmsbreath #2</b></td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed positions <b>or</b> 5-1 with D3 south</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Mortal Vow

There are *four* Mortal Vow passes in this phase.

1. After Hallowed Wings #1
2. After Wroth Flames (this pass is *quick*)
3. After Hallowed Wings #2
4. After Cauterize → Touchdown

We pass "DTTMR", or in other words:

```
DPS → MT → ST → D1/D2 → D3
```
All passes happen in the center of the arena, except for the final pass after Touchdown (which is just done at the edge).

## Wroth Flames

Wroth Flames is the "intermission" in this phase, separating the first and second iteration of each of the looped mechanics.

When dropping Akh Morns, the most efficient movement (geometrically) is to move **perpendicular from the wall in a straight line**, and then curve in after the third Akh Morn.

## Wyrmsbreath 2

This iteration of Wyrmsbreath is different because we **do not** want to stack opposite tethers.

There are two main methods to resolve this.

### Method 1: Fixed positions

This method fixes all player positions (except for the tanks), greatly simplifying the mechanic.

However, player positioning is precise, and depending on which dragon players are tethered to, they may take additional damage.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> NW if you get the single-target tankbuster (by Nidhogg).</li>
        <li><b>ST:</b> SE if you get the single-target tankbuster (by Hraesvelgr).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Tanks should use where the outer AoE intersects the boss's targeting circle as a reference point.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>H1:</b> As far true North as you can go.</li>
        <li><b>H2:</b> As far true South as you can go.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Be careful if a tank gets a single-target tankbuster, as you </em>may<em> be in range if poorly positioned.</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>D1:</b> NW corner of the white tile beside Nidhogg.</li>
        <li><b>D2:</b> Between the two white tiles besides Hraesvelgr.</li>
        <li><b>D3:</b> 1/2 a tile west of the western "train track", as far south as you can go.</li>
        <li><b>D4:</b> 1/2 a tile east of the eastern "train track", as far north as you can go.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Depending on which dragon you are tethered to, your tether <b>may not stretch fully</b>. Use personal mitigations to help survive.</em></p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/fixed_wyrmsbreath2.jpg"><a href="images/fixed_wyrmsbreath2.jpg"><em>(Full-sized image)</em></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Method 2: Spread tethers 5 North, 1 South (5-1)

This method has one player go south to give additional space for the other five non-tanks to spread out along the North edge.

All tethers can be fully stretched, however, players will need to adjust their positioning on the fly.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> SW if you get the single-target tankbuster (by Nidhogg).</li>
        <li><b>ST:</b> SE if you get the single-target tankbuster (by Hraesvelgr).</li>
        <li><b>D3:</b> Go south, and <b>move towards a dragon whose mouth is glowing</b>.</li>
        <li><b>All other players:</b> Spread out along the <b>north</b> edge.<ul><li>The north position should go to a <b>healer or caster</b> that is in the group with 3 tethers.</li></ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>(In this example, Hraesvelgr's mouth is glowing).</em></p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/wyrmsbreath_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Cauterize

The reason why we did not stack opposite tethers in Wyrmsbreath #2 was because we needed the fire/ice debuffs in order to survive this mechanic.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>1. Cauterize</b></p>
      <p>Nidhogg and Hraesvelgr will spawn along the north edge in a <b>random</b> orientation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MT:</b> West, in front of the other party members.</li>
        <li><b>ST:</b> East, in front of the other party members.</li>
        <li><b>Players with the Fire debuff:</b> Stand in front of Hraesvelgr.</li>
        <li><b>Players with the Ice debuff:</b> Stand in front of Nidhogg.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Do not move</b> once Nidhogg's debuff turns into Pyretic, or Hraesvelgr's Cauterize will kill you and enrage.</p><p>If you moved and took Pyretic damage, quickly switch over to Nidhogg's side to avoid getting killed by Hraesvelgr.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/cauterize_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>2. Mortal Vow pass #4</b></p>
      <p>After Cauterize, everybody gathers north to avoid Nidhogg's and Hraesvelgr's Touchdown damage.</p>
      <p>After Touchdown, all players move away from the stack point <em>except</em> the DPS with Mortal Vow and D3.</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="images/mortal_vow_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Notes

* DRK is the only tank that doesn't *actually* need Rampart in this phase, as Dark Mind's cooldown is quick enough for it to be available for both Hallowed Wings.
* There are strats where only one tank invulns Cauterize, or neither tank invulns Cauterize in order to have a 1-1-6 Akh Morn's edge in P7. While the recommended PF strat is to just invuln Cauterize, a static may consider having just one tank invuln Hraesvelgr's Cauterize (and have the other mitigate Nidhogg's). I personally wouldn't recommend having both tanks mitigate Cauterize.
* If a tank was hit by a fire or ice tether in Wyrmsbreath #2, they should also go in front of the appropriate dragon to get their debuff cleansed by Cauterize.
* If someone happens to move after the fire debuff turns into Pyretic, they should keep moving into the wall, or into Nidhogg's side so they do **not** die to Hraesvelgr.
