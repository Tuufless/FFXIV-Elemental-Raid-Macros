# Nael deus Darnus

One thing that makes Nael tricky is that although there are three lines leading up to Cauterize, there are *four* Fire/Ice/Lightning cycles so the two loops do not move in sync with one another.

The other difficulty is that the tempo in Nael's phase is *noticeably* faster compared to Twintania, or most other encounters in general. Keep that in mind when reading the diagrams below- the mechanics resolve in sequence one after the other *very* quickly.

## Quotes

Nael telegraphs her upcoming attacks by saying a line- key words in that line indicate what attacks she is about to do, and in what order.

The quotes that Nael will use in this phase are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>O <b>hallowed moon</b>, take <b>fire</b> and scorch my foes!</td>
    <td>Lunar Dynamo → Thermionic Beam</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>O <b>hallowed moon</b>, shine you the <b>iron</b> path!</td>
    <td>Lunar Dynamo → Iron Chariot</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Take <b>fire</b>, O <b>hallowed moon</b>!</td>
    <td>Thermionic Beam → Iron Chariot</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Blazing</b> path, lead me to <b>iron</b> rule!</td>
    <td>Thermionic Beam → Iron Chariot</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>hallowed moon</b> to call!</td>
    <td>Raven's Dive → Lunar Dynamo</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>iron</b> path to call!</p>
    <p>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>iron</b> path to walk!</p></td>
    <td>Raven's Dive → Iron Chariot</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fleeting light! 'Neath the <b>red moon</b>, <b>scorch</b> you the earth!</td>
    <td>Dalamud Dive → Thermionic Beam</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fleeting light! Amid a rain of <b>stars</b>, exalt you the <b>red moon!</b></td>
    <td>Meteor Stream →　Dalamud Dive</td>
  </tr>

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Dragon mechanics breakdown</b></summary>
<b>Fire and Ice</b>
One dragon will cycle through the party list, hitting each player with an Ice debuff. If a player has an active Fire debuff, the two will cancel out Ice. If a player already has Ice, this will kill the player.

Another dragon will periodically tether to a random player, and after a period, hit that player with a Fire AoE that applies a Fire debuff to any player hit. If a player has an active Ice debuff, the two will cancel out. If a player already has Fire, this will kill the player.

<b>Doom</b>
One dragon will target a random player for a white AoE that leaves behind a small puddle.

One dragon will Doom 2-3 players that will kill the players when the timer expires. The only way to remove the Doom is to step into a small white puddle left behind when Light explodes.

<b>Thunder</b>
The final dragon will periodically target two random party members with Thunder- a debuff that will go off in an AoE centered on that player that deals damage and paralyzes any <em>other</em> players that get hit.

## Fifth and Sixth lines

The sequence of mechanics after this point are:

1. Nael's fifth line
2. Nael's sixth line
3. Ravensbeak (tank swap)
4. Bahamut's Claw (5-hit tankbuster)
5. Megaflare (enrage)

The fifth and sixth lines are a random selection of any combination from Nael's first three lines.

This is much simpler now that the dragons are gone, so the party will no longer need to contend with Fire/Ice, Thunder, or Doom.
