# Bahamut Prime

While progging Bahamut, it may be useful to learn how to cheese Seventh Umbral Era so that you begin Quickmarch Trio with an LB3 (or at least very close to it).

This will let you save runs with a healer LB3 that would otherwise result in a wipe, allowing the group to get some more practice in.

{% include youtube.html id="L6UnJ42eEMk" %}

LB is built if someone in the party takes lethal damage, but is saved by shields or in this case, mitigation from the tank LB3. This is we build the LB gauge by doing a 5-man Fireball stack at Twintania (increase damage to lethal by removing players, who are then saved by the shields).

The knockback damage from Seventh Umbral Era is based on proximity to the center.

There are four damage pulses in the transition to Bahamut- three weak ones (Calamitous Flame), and one strong one (Calamitous Blaze).

The goal is to go down to around 6k HP, at which point Calamitous Flame would have killed the party in the absence of tank LB3. If players are taking too little damage, consider removing shields, or standing closer. If someone's HP goes below 3k at the knockback, they are too close.

With a tank LB3 (80% mitigation), each weak damage pulse hits for a little under 1.4k damage, and the strong one for around 5.5k.

The healers should start casting a heal to make it in time for Calamitous Blaze, but watch out in case some party members are too low HP after the knockback (under 2.8k HP).

## Quickmarch Trio

Bahamut opens with a Flare Breath into Flatten (and an auto-attack) before starting the first of many Trios.

## Blackfire Trio

After Quickmarch Trio, Bahamut Flare Breathes into Flatten again, before moving onto the second Trio.

## Fellruin Trio

After Blackfire Trio, Bahamut Flare Breaths three times, before starting Fellruin Trio.

The two possible quotes Nael will use are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>From on high I <b>descend</b>, the <b>moon</b> and <b>stars</b> to bring!</td>
    <td>Raven's Dive → Lunar Dynamo → Meteor Stream</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>From <b>hallowed moon</b> I <b>descend</b>, a rain of <b>stars</b> to bring!</td>
    <td>Lunar Dynamo → Raven's Dive → Meteor Stream</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note that Nael's lines now telegraph *three* mechanics instead of two.

<table>
  <th width="34%"></th>
  <th width="33%">From hallowed moon I descend, a rain of stars to bring!</th>
  <th>From on high I descend, the moon and stars to bring!</th>

    <td colspan="2"><img src="../images/03_bahamut/fellruin_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Heavensfall Trio

After Blackfire Trio, Bahamut *immediately* turns to Flare Breath the tank, before doing Flatten into Flare Breath.

Bahamut then starts Heavensfall Trio, marking the halfway point in the fight.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Stack center, and locate the three bosses.</p><p>One player will get marked for Bahamut's dive, while another player will get marked for Twintania's dive.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_bahamut/heavensfall_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Spread out as follows:</p><ul><li><b>MT, ST:</b> Towards Nael.</li><li><b>H1, D1:</b> To the left of the three bosses.</li><li><b>H2, D2:</b> To the right of the three bosses.</li><li><b>D3, D4:</b> Opposite Nael.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_bahamut/heavensfall_02b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This will end up looking like one of the three diagrams below:

<table>
  <th width="33.3%" style="text-align:center">Nael left</th>
  <th width="33.3%" style="text-align:center">Nael middle</th>

## Tenstrike Trio

Just like after Blackfire Trio, Bahamut will Flare Breath the tank three times before starting Tenstrike Trio.

## Grand Octet (with Tank LB)

After Tenstrike, Bahamut Flattens and Flare Breaths before starting Grand Octet.

Bahamut must be **below 60% HP** by the time it disappears for Grand Octet, or it will gain a damage-up buff in Golden Bahamut, making it impossible to clear the fight (although you will still be able to prog the adds phase).

*(This should* really *not be a problem nowadays.)*

### Grand Octet (without Tank LB3)

If you don't have tank LB3, then Grand Octet becomes significantly harder.

Everything stays the same for the last part, except player roles are now fixed.

- The Twintania player still goes to Twintania's left.
- **Megaflare players stack on Twintania's right.**
- **Non-Megaflare players take towers.**

However, the Twintania player may be part of the Megaflare group, or the towers (non-Megaflare) group.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>If the Twintania player does not have Megaflare</b></p><ul><li>The other three players without Megaflare markers take three of the four towers, <b>leaving the nearest tower to Twintania empty</b>.</li><li>The four players with Megaflare loosely stack together on Twintania's right.</li></ul><p>When Twintania's divebomb marker appears, the Twintania player goes to the empty tower.</p></td>
