# Nael deus Darnus

One thing that makes Nael tricky is that although there are three lines 
leading up to *Cauterize*, there are *four* Fire/Ice/Lightning cycles so the 
two loops do not move in sync with one another.

The other difficulty is that the tempo in Nael's phase is *noticeably* faster 
compared to Twintania, or most other encounters in general. Keep that in mind 
when reading the diagrams below- the mechanics resolve in sequence one after 
the other quickly.

## Quotes

Nael telegraphs her upcoming attacks by saying a line- key words in that line indicate what attacks she is about to do, and in what order.

The quotes that Nael will use in this phase are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>O <b>hallowed moon</b>, take <b>fire</b> and scorch my foes!</td>
    <td>
      <p>Lunar Dynamo → Thermionic Beam</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

## Fourth line (Cauterize)

The party will have to resolve Nael's fourth line in conjunction with divebombs.

- Three random players (other than the tank currently holding hate) will get 
  marked with a green marker.
- When the marker *disappears*, the dragons that will dive will lock onto where 
  that player was standing at the time, and then dive at that position.
- There are three dives in total in a 2-1-2 configuration:
  - The first two dragons clockwise from north (including north).
  - The third dragon clockwise from north.
  - The last two dragons clockwise from north.
- The goal is to direct these divebombs away from the center of the arena where 
  the rest of the party is.
- Nael will also drop Hypernova AoEs on the first two baiters.

You can use this site to practice divebomb placement:

## Fifth and Sixth lines

The sequence of mechanics after this point are:

1. Nael's fifth line
2. Nael's sixth line
3. Ravensbeak (tank swap)
4. Bahamut's Claw (5-hit tankbuster)
5. Megaflare (enrage)

The fifth and sixth lines are a random selection of any combination from 
Nael's first three lines.

This is much simpler now that the dragons are gone, so the party will no
longer need to contend with Fire/Ice, Thunder, or Doom.

## Seventh Umbral Era (Transition to Bahamut)

Depending on how the party did with Twintania and Nael, you should have 
either a Tank LB2 or LB3 available at this point.

Stack together at the south Neurolink (same place where you stacked for the 
transition to Nael) to prepare for a knockback.

- If you have LB2: Tank LB **before** the knockback.
- If you have LB3: Tank LB **at** the knockback.

The giant fireball will then pulse four times for raidwide damage- three weak 
pulses *(Calamitous Flame)*, followed by one strong pulse at the end 
*(Calamitous Blaze)*.

### Recovering LB3

If you have an LB3 at the end of Nael, it may be useful to learn how to cheese 
*Seventh Umbral Era* so that you begin *Quickmarch Trio* with an LB3 (or at 
least very close to it), especially while progging Bahamut.

This will let you save runs with a healer LB3 that would otherwise result in a 
wipe, allowing the group to get some more practice in.

{% include youtube.html id="L6UnJ42eEMk" %}

LB is built if someone in the party takes lethal damage, but is saved by 
shields or in this case, mitigation from the tank LB3. This is how we build the 
LB gauge at Twintania by doing a 5-man *Fireball* stack (increase damage to 
lethal by removing players, who are then saved by the shields).

The knockback damage from *Seventh Umbral Era* is based on proximity to the 
center.

The goal is to go down to around 6k HP, at which point *Calamitous Flame* would 
have killed the party in the absence of tank LB3. If players are taking too 
little damage, consider removing shields, or standing closer. If someone's HP 
goes below 3k at the knockback, they are too close.

With a tank LB3 (80% mitigation), each weak damage pulse hits for a little 
under 1.4k damage, and the strong one for around 5.5k.

The healers should start casting a heal to make it in time for *Calamitous 
Blaze*, but watch out in case some party members are too low HP after the 
knockback (under 2.8k HP).
