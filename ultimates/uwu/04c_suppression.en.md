# Ultimate Suppression

Unlike the other phases in this fight, you can push Ultima into *Ultimate
Suppression* early- *Ultimate Suppression* will start when Ultima Weapon
goes **under 50% HP**.

Note that you **must** have a Tank LB3 when *Ultimate Suppression* ends- if you
haven't built enough LB by this time, you may want to consider holding DPS to
buy more time.

---

## Pre-Suppression

The important part of this phase, **especially** if DPS has been low is to
shield the *Vulcan Bursts* to prevent them from knocking players out of the
arena.

## Ultimate Suppression

          targeted for a <em>Granite Gaol</em>- this player must still place
          their fourth Eruption behind the sister, but does not need to dodge
          out of it.</p>

      this time, this is a lot of damage.</p>
      <p>The feathers will also explode in a point-blank

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Feather Lance]</b> What causes the feathers to converge in on the party?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is actually a Woken Garuda mechanic that you can see in P1 if you
      cleanse <em>three sets</em> of <em>Thermal Low</em> stacks using the
      Spiny Plume's bubble instead of two.</p>
      <p>The feathers will all home in on party members, killing them- the way
      to prevent this is to knock them out of the air by cleansing and
      triggering a <em>Thermal Low</em> (by taking Garuda's tether).</p>
