# Ultimate Annihilation

This is the second of the four blocks in in Ultima Weapon's timeline.

## Pre-Annihilation

Ultima Weapon will then disappear and then reappear where it stands (arena North), and begin Ultimate Annihilation.

## Ultimate Annihilation (2211)

This phase is unique among all the "Trio"-like mechanics in all Ultimate fights as Ultima Weapon will actually be targetable during this sequence.

In this section, there will be four green Aetheroplasm orbs for the party to take- how you resolve these orbs affects the Aetheric Boom mechanic towards the end of the fight.

Of note, these orbs will always spawn on Ultima Weapon's left leg (the south-east corner).

  <tr>
    <td><p><b>11.</b> Third set of Weight of the Land, which is also when the Flaming Crush resolves.</p><p>The party will need to split up as follows:<ul><li><b>MT, ST:</b> Move east to take the first Aetheroplasm orb.</li><li><b>H1, H2:</b> Move west.</li><li><b>D1, D2, D4:</b> Move north, to the side of Ultima Weapon.</li><li><b>D3:</b> Move south and take the Mesohigh tether.</li></ul></p></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>16.</b> Ultima Weapon casts a Tank Purge while the Mesohigh tether resolves.</p><p>Note this is a lot of outgoing damage and should be mitigated, as the healer taking the Mesohigh tether will also trigger additional raid-wide damage.</p><p>Finally, Garuda jumps <em>(Dodge Feather Rains)</em>.<ul><li><b>MT:</b> Take the fourth Aetheroplasm orb solo.</li><li><b>Healer with Searing Wind:</b> Stay south.</li></ul></p></td>
	<td><img src="../images/annihilation/annihilation_16.jpg"></td>
  </tr>

After the Feather Rains, Ultima Weapon momentarily disappears, marking the end of this phase.

## Aetheroplasm Orbs

The number of people that are hit by the Aetheroplasm Orbs determine the time the party has to take the four pairs of orbs later on in Aetheric Boom.

- 1st: NW orb
- 2nd: NE orb
- 3rd: SE orb
- 4th: SW orb

The more players that are hit increases the distance between the two orbs, giving the party more time to resolve them.

However, each person hit also increases the Ultima Aether gauge by 1.
