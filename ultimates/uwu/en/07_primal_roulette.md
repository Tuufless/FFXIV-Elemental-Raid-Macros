# Primal Roulette

This is the final phase of the fight.

## Ultima #2

Ultima Weapon reappears in the center of the arena and starts casting another Ultima.

This **requires** a Tank LB3 to survive, which you should have rebuilt at this stage.

## Aetheric Boom

After the Ultima, quickly top up the party and prepare for Aetheric Boom.

Four tethered pairs of orbs will spawn. The tethers will pull the orbs together and will wipe the party if they touch.

The length of the tether is determined by **the number of players** that took the green Aetheroplasm orbs during Ultimate Annihilation.

- 1st Aetheroplasm Orb → NW tether
- 2nd Aetheroplasm Orb → NE tether
- 3rd Aetheroplasm Orb → SE tether
- 4th Aetheroplasm Orb → SW tether

Since the last two orbs in Ultimate Annihilation were taken solo by the MT, these two pairs will have the shortest tether, so we start from the southern orbs.

## Primal Roulette

Ultima Weapon will apply three Vicious Aetheroplasm debuffs on three random players to mark the start of the Primal Roulette.

Some things to take note:

- The Vicious Aetheroplasms will each go off during the upcoming Primal sequences, essentially forcing the party to move together as a group.
- The Primals will then do their signature attack (Aerial Blast, Hellfire, Earthern Fury) to mark the end of their sequence. However, because they are **not targetable**, you **will not** be able to use targeted mitigations like Reprisal or Addle to mitigate the damage.

A recommended mitigation plan is as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>First primal</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, H2 30s, H2 shields</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Second primal</b></td>
    <td><p>H2 enhanced shields*, D3</p><p><em>* Deployed Adloquium or Zoe'd Eukrasian Prognosis.</em></p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Third primal</b></td>
    <td>ST 90s, H2 30s, H2 shields</td>
  </tr>
</table>

While you can simply observe and react to whichever Primal appears, the order is not completely random. Once you see the first Primal, the other two are determined:

- Garuda → Ifrit → Titan *or*
- Ifrit → Garuda → Titan *or*
- Titan → Ifrit → Garuda

### Garuda

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Garuda readies a Wicked Wheel from the center of the arena.</p><p>Stand just outside the Wicked Wheel and prepare to enter.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_garuda_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> <em>Quickly</em> dodge into the Wicked Wheel AoE to avoid the follow-up Wicked Tornado.</p><p>One Vicious Aetheroplasm debuff will go off around this time.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_garuda_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Garuda then jumps <em>(dodge Feather Rains!)</em><p>Return North and prepare for the next Primal.</p></p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_garuda_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Ifrit

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Woken Ifrit spawns in the middle of the arena, and targets random players for Violent Eruption.</p><p>Two Ifrit clones spawn at cardinal positions.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_ifrit_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> <em>Quickly</em> run to the NW corner to dodge the Crimson Cyclones.</p><p><em>(Sprint is <b>highly recommended</b>.)</em></p><p>One Vicious Aetheroplasm debuff will also go off around this time.</p></td>

    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_ifrit_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Titan

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>1.</b> Titan begins with three Weight of the Lands.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_titan_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> Second set of Weight of the Land.</p><p>One Vicious Aetheroplasm debuff will go off around this time.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_titan_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Third set of Weight of the Land.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_titan_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> Titan then casts Earthern Fury, before jumping.</p><p>Return North and prepare for the next Primal.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/primal_roulette/primal_roulette_titan_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Once all three Primal sequences are complete, Ultima Weapon will teleport to the North of the arena and begin rapidly charging up his Ultima Aether.

When the Ultima Aether gauge reaches 100, party members will be incapacitated one-by-one, starting from the player that did the least damage to the player that did the most.

This serves as Ultima Weapon's enrage, although note that there are still a few seconds for DoTs to tick even after the last player has been defeated.
