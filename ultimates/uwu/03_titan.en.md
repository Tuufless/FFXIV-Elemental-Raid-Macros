# Titan

Titan is the last of the three Primals, and is easily the hardest to wake.

---

## Waking Titan

After a knockback, Titan will target three random players (excluding the MT) to
be trapped in a Granite Gaol.

A boulder will spawn opposite Titan and explode in an AoE. When a *Granite Gaol* 
is hit by this AoE, it will explode and leave behind a sludge puddle that 
slows movement and applies a DoT. This explosion will also trigger any other 
*Granite Gaols* hit.

Thus, the idea is to chain the three gaoled players between Titan and the 
opposite rock, resulting in a chain explosion that will put a sludge puddle in
contact with Titan.

**Titan gains a stack of *Aetherically Charged* for each DoT tick applied by
this sludge puddle.**

The following mechanics will also change when Titan is woken:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Normal</th>
    <th>Woken</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Landslide</td>
    <td>Five straight-line AoEs.</td>
    <td>Five straight-line AoEs, <b>followed by a second set of five
    straight-line AoEs that bisect the first set</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weight of the Land</td>
    <td>Two sets of baited AoEs under random players.</td>
    <td><b>Three sets</b> of baited AoEs under random players.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The **MT** will take hate at the start of the fight.

      <p><b>1.</b> Have the <b>MT</b> tank Titan facing south, with the party 
      North.</p>
      <p>Titan opens with <em>Earthern Fury</em> (heavy raid damage), and start
      a <em>Rock Buster → Mountain Buster</em> sequence.</p>
      <p><em>Mountain Buster</em> is particularly dangerous because it is
      always preceeded with a <em>Rock Buster</em>.</p>

When a woken Titan is defeated, it will also leave behind a light puddle that 
will give a player the *Beyond Limits* buff.

<table>

## Ultima Transition

At this point, a healer, a caster, and a melee should have the *Beyond Limits* 
buff.

When a player with the *Beyond Limits* uses an LB3, the buff will be consumed 
and the LB3 will be replenished. This lets the party LB3 four times in a row
(in order):

1. Caster
2. Healer
3. Melee
4. Tank

Start the Caster LB when the Magitek Bits land (and the party takes impact
damage). All other LBs can be used as soon as the LB3 bar replenishes.
