# Omega Reconfigured

This is the only phase in the fight with a transitional mechanic.

## Mitigations

This phase requires some mitigation planning. Each round of Hello, World
requires at least three mitigations for the party to survive all damage
*without* healing in between.

One such mitigation plan is:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">All with H2 shields, and:</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Hello, World</b></td>
    <td><p>MT Reprisal, H2 30s, D1, D4</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Towers #1</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, ST Reprisal, D2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Towers #2</b></td>
    <td><p>H1 120s, H2 120s</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Towers #3</b></td>
    <td><p>MT Reprisal, ST 90s, D3</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Towers #4</b></td>
    <td><p>ST Reprisal, D1, D4</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Critical Error</b></td>
    <td>MT 90s, H2 30s, D2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## Hello, World

Although Hello, World may look overwhelming at first, there are really just two
variations, determined by which colour debuff (Critical Performance and
Critical Underflow) get paired with Critical Overflow and Critical
Synchronization.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_0_0a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_0_0b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Blue is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
      has Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png"></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><em>"Red is Defamation"</em></p>
      <p>Critical Overflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_overflow_bug.png">
      has Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png"></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

After that, Hello, World is simply a cycle of debuffs to resolve. At any one
point, two players will be at each stage in the cycle.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>The basic loop consists of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Orientate to coloured towers.</li>
        <li>Pair players together:
          <ul>

            <li>Critical Synchronizations <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">

        and Critical Synchronizations <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_synchronization_bug.png">
        resolve.</li>
        <li>Pass Critical Underflow <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_underflow_bug.png">
        (red Nisi) and Critical Performance <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/critical_performance_bug.png">
        (blue Nisi). Break Remote Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/remote_regression.png">
        (blue tethers).</li>
        <li>Break Local Regression <img style="height:1em" src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/debuffs/local_regression.png">
        (red/green tethers).</li>
        <li>Repeat the loop with the next mechanic in the cycle.
          <ul>
            <li><em>If you just took a tower, you will swap sides/colours for
            the next iteration.</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="../images/03_omega_reconfigured/hello_world_cycle.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This loop is repeated four times (so all players will have their go at each
debuff), although the final iteration has one small difference where the Local
Regression players stand away from the Critical Overflows instead.

### First iteration

For brevity's sake, we will only display the relevant debuffs from here
onwards.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
  <p><b>Tip:</b> The boss will still be auto-attacking the tanks during Hello,
  World.</p>
  <p>These should be mitigated by cycling through your cooldowns to help reduce
  strain on the healers. Tank swap after the second set of towers to cycle
  through the ST's mitigations.</p>
</div>
<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p>
  <b>Tip:</b> The party will be taking raid-wide damage from Critical Overflow,
  Critical Synchronization, and the two tethers. Three mitigations (including
  shields) are needed for non-tanks to survive all the damage without any
  additional healing.</p>
  <p>Boss debuffs (Reprisal, Dismantle, Feint, Addle) are particularly handy
  because having all players in range can be tricky.</p>

## Oversampled Wave Cannon

Omega then brings back its "monitors" mechanic from O12S-2, with the added
twist that three random players *also* get their own set of monitors to
resolve.

With four monitors in total (Omega and three players) and each monitor hitting
two players, the party needs to arrange themselves such that all players will
take exactly one monitor hit each.

      <p>This is an extension of the mechanic "Oversampled Wave Cannon" from
      O12S-2.</p>
      <p>Monitors will appear on one side of Omega, and two random players on
      the side with the monitors will be hit with an AoE. If there are fewer
      than two players, then a random player (from anywhere) is selected for
      each player missing instead.</p>
      <p>This phase extends the idea and adds monitors to players that work the
      same way- when the debuff resolves, two random players on the monitor
      side of the debuffed <em>player</em> will be selected for an AoE.</p>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Local Regression]</b> Why do the Local Regression players not stand with
  the Critical Overflows in the final iteration?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Omega casts "Critical Error" at the end of Hello, World.</p>
      <p>This will apply a new Critical Overflow Bug onto <em>all</em> players.
      However, because all players have the Critical Overflow Debugger buff,
      this additional Critical Overflow Bug is blocked.</p>
      <p>If the Local Regression players stayed with the Critical Overflow
      players in the final iteration, their Critical Overflow Debugger buffs
      would get consumed there instead.</p>
      <p>As as result, they won't have the Critical Overflow Debugger buff when
      Omega casts Critical Error, and will get another round of Critical
      Overflows that will last into Oversampled Wave Cannon.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Why are the healers north-most? Doesn't
  putting healers south-most guarantee the southern spot goes to a ranged?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Putting all four ranged players south <em>guarantees</em> that the
    southern player is a ranged, thus providing full melee uptime even in the
    scenario where all three monitor players are ranged, but the chances of
    this happening are 1/14.</p>
    <p>Putting healers at the north side means that both extremeties will have
    ranged players in the average case, which allows them to go all the way to
    the edge of the arena to give the other players more room for error, the
    north-most monitor player in particular.</p>
    <p>That being said, doing so means that a melee may have to disconnect from
    the boss in the worst case scenario, but this is an acceptable scenario
    given its likelihood.</p></td>
  </tr>

</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary>
  <b>[Oversampled Wave Cannon]</b> Are two of the monitor players supposed to
  be angled slightly up and down as shown in the diagram?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Astoh's original diagram had those players look exactly East/West
      horizontally, and that's still fine and a workable strat.</p>
      <p>However, the problem with going horizontally is that if you're off by
      a little bit, there's a chance you accidentally clip the player on the
      far East/West (marked "3"). It doesn't help that Omega in the center is
      blocking your view of that player.</p>
      <p>One of the advantages of Astoh's strat is that each monitor player can
      clearly see the <b>two</b> other players they are supposed to hit with
      their monitors (without Omega in the way). Tilting up/down a little gives
      you additional margin of error to not hit the player at "3"- you can tilt
      as much as you want, so long as you still hit the two people you're
      supposed to (who aren't blocked by Omega).</p>
