<b>Tip:</b> If tanks use Rampart at the end of the previous phase (when Omega jumps away), Rampart will cover this <em>Solar Ray</em> and be back up in time for the tethers in <em>Limitless Synergy</em>.</div>

After a while, Omega-M and Omega-F will both cast *Party Synergy*, the first major mechanic of this phase.

Identifying the first set of safe spots will take some practice. Nukemaru has compiled a collection of clips which may help:

## Limitless Synergy

Omega-M and Omega-F will reappear in the middle of the arena.

The two Omega clones will swap genders (the tank who previously had hate on Omega-M will now have hate on Omega-F). Both tanks will need to Provoke their target as the Packet Filter debuff is still on.

After three autoattacks, the two clones will cast *Limitless Synergy* and the Packet Filter debuffs will drop, so the party can now hit either target.

Omega-F will teleport North and begin casting *Laser Shower*, which acts as the hard-enrage. Omega-M will teleport to the middle of the arena and shield Omega-F, rendering her invulnerable until Omega-M is defeated.

Meanwhile, five more Omega-M/F clones outside the arena will throw various mechanics at the party to resolve.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Firewall]</b> Should I apply DoTs on the other target before Firewall resolves?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>No. The Firewall effectively only lets you damage either Omega-M <em>or</em> Omega-F, but not both (even certain abilities like Reprisal are blocked).</p><p>If you apply a DoT on the other target before Firewall resolves, it will technically tick, but deals 0 damage.</p></td></tr>

<summary><b>[Party Synergy]</b> Is there a reason why the order is 〇×△□?</summary>
