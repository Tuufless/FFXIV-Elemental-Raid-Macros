# Run: Dynamis (Omega Version)

Run: Dynamis (Omega Version) can be split down into the following three blocks:

1. [Dodging AoEs](#1-dodging-aoes)
2. [Hello, World #1 with Oversampled Wave Cannon](#2-first-hello-world-with-monitors)
3. [Hello, World #2 with tethers](#3-second-hello-world-with-tethers)

## 1. Dodging AoEs

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Unlike Delta and Sigma, Omega-F will stay on the arena during this part of Omega.</p><p>Omega Reconfigured will spawn in the center, and a Omega-M/F pair will spawn at opposite intercardinal positions, again with a random Sword/Shield and Staff/Blade-Legs combo.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> A second Omega-M/F pair will spawn at the remaining two intercardinal positions, again with a random Sword/Shield and Staff/Blade-Legs combo.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>3.</b> Omega will channel a Diffuse Wave Cannon ("lights") at two opposite cardinal directions.</p><p>This must be resolved together with the first Omega-M/F pair's AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>4.</b> The Omega Reconfigured will then repeat this at the other two cardinal directions, which must be resolved together with the second Omega-M/F pair's AoEs.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_04.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>Tip:</b> Omega-F will auto-attack a total of eight times during this whole sequence, and tanks cannot use cooldowns to mitigate them because of the upcoming Solar Ray.</p><p>Consider tank-swapping halfway (around the first AoE dodge) to split the auto-attack damage between the two tanks.</p></div>

Identifying the safe spots will take some practice.

## 2. First Hello, World with Monitors

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>5.</b> Omega will then present a single monitor set, to be resolved together with the first set of Hello, World debuffs.</p>
    <p>Omega's monitors will be taken by two players with two Dynamis stacks. However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player(s) with with two Dynamis stacks and Second in Line <b>must</b> take Omega's monitors.</li>
      <li>Player(s) with with two Dynamis stacks and First in Line, <b>cannot</b> take Omega's monitors <em>(because they'll resolve their Hello, World instead)</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aside from the two players taking monitors and the two players with First in Line, we <em>roughly</em> order the remaining four players:</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><b>North:</b> H1 MT D1 D3 D4 D2 ST H2 <b>:South</b></p>
    <p><em>In this example, H1, D2, D3, and D4 each have two stacks of Dynamis.</em></p><ul><li><em>D2 has Second in Line, so they <b>must</b> take Omega's monitor.</em></li><li><em>H1 has First in Line, so they <b>cannot</b> take Omega's monitor.</em></li><li><em>Either D3 or D4 can be the second player to take Omega's monitor.</em></li></ul>
    <p>Once everyone has taken up their positions, the player with Hello, Near World can move a little bit away from the player with Hello, Distant World to ensure Hello, Near World jumps to the correct players.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_05.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>6.</b> Hello, World debuffs resolve.</p><p>Done correctly, there should be:</p><ul><li>Two players with three Dynamis stacks.<ul><li>These players should <em>not</em> have the second set of Hello, World debuffs.</li></ul></li><li>The other six players should all have two Dynamis stacks.</li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 3. Second Hello, World with tethers

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>7.</b> Omega then spawns at a random cardinal position, and tethers to two players. These are the same tethers from P1.</p><ul><li><b>Players with 3 stacks:</b> Take the tethers and stand beside Omega.</li><li><p><b>Everybody else:</b> Form up opposite Omega to resolve Hello, Worlds.</p><p>Similarly here, aside from the two players taking tethers and the two players with Second in Line, we <em>roughly</em> order the remaining four players:</p>
    <p style="text-align:center"><b>Left:</b> H1 MT D1 D3 D4 D2 ST H2 <b>:Right</b></p>
    <p>Again, the player with Hello, Near World can move away from the player with Hello, Distant World to ensure Near World jumps to the correct players.</p></li></ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_07.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>8.</b> Hello, World debuffs resolve.</p><p>All players should now have three Dynamis stacks each.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/05_run_dynamis/run_dynamis_omega_08.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Omega-F then does one more set of Solar Ray tankbusters before casting Blind Faith.

Like Blue Screen, Omega-F **must** be brought to under 20% HP by the end of Blind Faith's cast to proceed onto the final phase of the fight.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hello, World (Omega)]</b> What's the reasoning behind the HTDTH order?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The goal is to give all players a rough starting location to work with.</p><p>In particular, while the two center positions taking Hello, Near World are fairly easy to adjust for, the two extreme positions for Hello, Distant World are harder.</p><p>We give the healers priority on the two extremes because they are the only role that has to do something extra (top up the party), and giving them the highest priority at the extremes leaves them with one less thing to think about.</p><p>The tanks are next because our Arm Laser priority in Sigma mean that it is quite likely that tanks will not be taking Omega's tethers (and will be taking Hello, World here instead).</p><p>This then leaves all the DPS to start in the middle. DPS also have more movement tools available to adjust to the extreme positions if needed.</p></td></tr>
