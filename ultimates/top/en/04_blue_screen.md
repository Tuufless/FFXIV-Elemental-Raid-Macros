# Blue Screen

After defeating Omega in the previous phase, Omega will "reboot", resetting its HP to 100% and begin the phase.

This phase is a short, 55-second race to bring Omega's HP below 20% before Omega's enrage (Blue Screen) goes off.

In the meantime, the party will need to deal with simple stack/spread mechanics while dodging the expanding donut AoEs from the earlier transition phase.

<div style="background-color: #002 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>Tip:</b> The stack deals more damage than the spread.</p><p>Mitigations that last 15-seconds are best used after the spread beams in order to cover two stacks.</p></div>
