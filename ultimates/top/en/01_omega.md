# Omega

## Program Loop

Players receive a set of numbered debuffs. Each number (1, 2, 3, and 4) each have two players.

- The **numbered** debuffs incidate the order players need to take **towers** (1 > 2 > 3 > 4).
- **Tethers** are resolved two steps away from the towers (3 > 4 > 1 > 2)

When tethers resolve, they explode in a large AoE, applying one stack of Twice-come Ruin and a HP Penalty debuff that reduces that player's maximum HP to 1%.

The HP Penalty debuff will wear off within two steps (players numbered 3 and 4 will need healing to survive their towers).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p>There are eight possible tower spawn points.</p><p>Two towers will always spawn at a time, and they will always be either 90 degrees, or 180 degrees from one another.</p><p>Towers will not spawn in the same position twice in a row.</p><p>We establish a priority to determine who takes which tower/tether:</p><ul><li><b>CW from NW:</b> H1 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 H2</li></ul></td>

After the fourth set of towers, top up the party when the last sets of HP Penalties wear off, and prepare for Omega's next mechanic.

## Pantokrator

We decided to go with **HaruGlory's** Pantokrator strat, which puts the beam at the back, and the missile in front.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>1.</b> Tank Omega facing North.</p><p>The rest of the party can stay near the center of the arena, ready to adjust if needed.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>2.</b> The party will be numbered again in pairs of 1-4.</p>
    <p>Split the party into two groups, one referencing NW, and the other referencing SE:</p>
    <p>We need to split the party into two groups of four such that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each group has one of each number.</li>
      <li>Each group has one healer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To do so, we use the following priority order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>NW:</b> H1 MT ST D1 D2 D3 D4 H2 <b>:SE</b></li>
    </ul></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The first set of Flamethrower telegraphs will appear. If the Flamethrowers hit the NW and SE points, rotate **clockwise** to the next safe sector. These will be your starting sectors.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_02a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_02b.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_02c.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_02d.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><p>The movement for Pantokrator goes like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Wave Cannon hits.</li>
        <li>Everybody moves forward for one AoE.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Everybody continues to <b>stagger-step</b> forward, while the next player to bait the missile then breaks away from the party:</p>
      <ol start="3">
        <li>Drop the next AoE in the center.</li>
        <li>Drop the next AoE in the front (the next round of beams + missiles resolves here).</li>
        <li>Drop the next AoE back and <b>out</b>.</li>
        <li>Rejoin the party. You have one extra AoE to do so before the next beam + missile resolves.</li>
      </ol>
    </td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_movement.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Put together, it will look something like this:

    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_06.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>10.</b> First set of AoEs (after beam + missile).</p><ul><li><b>1s:</b> Rejoin the party.</li><li><b>2s:</b> Move into the middle of the arena to start pulling away from the group.</li></ul></td>

  </tr>
</table>

The loop repeats two more times (with players numbered 3 and 4 taking their turns to leave the stack to bait missiles).

### Wave Cannons

Omega will target the two **furthest** players for 120-degree tankbuster cleaves (Diffuse Wave Cannon Kyrios). These should be taken by the tanks.

Omega will then target the three random non-tank players with a red marker for Wave Cannon Kyrios.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><p><b>16.</b> Both tanks stack north, <b>outside</b> Omega's targeting circle and use their invulnerabilities.</p><p>This gives enough space for the rest of the party spreads around the south half of the arena <b>inside</b> of Omega's targeting circle.</p><p>Three random (non-tank) players will be selected for the first set of Wave Cannons.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/wave_cannons_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>17.</b> First set of Wave Cannons resolve.</p><p>The other three players get marked for the second set of Wave Cannons.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/wave_cannons_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p><b>17.</b> Second set of Wave Cannons resolve.</p><p>After this, Omega casts Atomic Ray, serving as the hard enrage.</p></td>
    <td><img src="../images/01_omega/wave_cannons_03.jpg"></td>
  </tr>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Pantokrator]</b> Why does the party group up NW and SE instead of N and S?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is done because the Flamethrowers are based on Omega's orientation.</p><p>The problem with facing Omega directly at the party (if they were to start N/S) is that the Flamethrowers are 60-degree cones that move in multiples of 30 degrees.</p><p>This means that you can have a scenario like the following, where it's now ambiguous whether the N/S parties count as getting hit.</p><p>This is especially problematic when the agreed movement is "always rotate clockwise to the safe sector", which is clearly not ideal in this scenario.</p><p>By pointing Omega at a 45 degree angle from the two assigned points, you guarantee that Omega's Flamethrower will <em>never</em> end up in this scenario, removing said ambiguity altogether.</p></td>
  <td><img src="../images/01_omega/pantokrator_faq.jpg"></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Pantokrator]</b> Why do we resolve the stack at the back instead of the front?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>There are a few advantages to stacking at the back:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Only the first pair of missile players really need to pay attention to which way the Flamethrowers rotate at the beginning.</li>
    <li>With only one person in front of the party, there is much less variation from run-to-run as there is only one AoE to potentially dodge.</li>
    <li>The first set of AoEs can be baited inside the Flamethrower, giving the party more room to work with.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition, putting the stack in front (missile at the back) has the following disadvantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The missile player at the back is potentially blocked by <em>three</em> player's AoEs and it's much easier to accidentally box them in, leaving them with nowhere to go.</li>
    <li>Furthermore, when something <em>does</em> go wrong, it is much harder to diagnose what the root problem is, as things often look okay from one player's perspective, but has trickle-down consequences for other players.</li>
  </ul></td></tr>
</table>
</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Pantokrator]</b> Why does someone keep getting an AoE dropped in front of them?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td>
  <p>Check that all players move the same way.</p>
  <p>There are actually <em>two</em> ways to drop AoEs during Pantokrator.</p>
  <p>We have the next missile player stay with the group for one more AoE after the Wave Cannon, before breaking away to the front (the yellow path).</p>
  <p>There is a faster path that Haru Glory used at the beginning of their prog that has the next missile player break away immediately when the Wave Cannon hits (the green path).</p>
  <p>There will be a problem when one player does the slow, yellow path, and the next player does the faster, green path. The front player's AoEs won't have gone off by the time the next player wants to move into that spot.</p>
  <p>Haru Glory's group also swapped to the slower path later on.</p>
