# Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser

My preferred method of doing this phase is using [my Tollgate strat](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/10898230/blog/4941271/) that is very similar to MOOF's strat that stacks both bosses in the middle.

The "Tollgate" name comes from the third Nisi pass, where the tanks and healers line up to take/pass Nisi. Someone mentioned that passing Nisi here felt like passing through a tollgate, and the name stuck.

The strat simplifies the Water/Lightning and Nisi passes, **but at the cost of increased Tank damage.** This phase is already one of the more healing-intensive fights, so be prepared.

Tanks should try to have minor cooldowns available for the Lightning passes.

<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Water/Thunder and Nisi breakdown</b></summary>
<p>This phase contains two "hot potato" loops that the party must handle simultaneously.</p>
<p><b>Loop 1: Water/Thunder:</b></p>
<p>These are two 30-second debuffs that are applied on two players when Brute Justice casts Link-up.</p><p>When the timer expires, the debuff explodes in a shared-damage AoE, centered on the affected player.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the player with the debuff ever dies, the debuff explodes and wipe the raid.</li>
  <li>After the explosion, the debuff transfers to a random player that was hit.</li>
  <li>If the debuff cannot be passed to a new player this way (e.g: nobody else was hit), it explodes and wipes the raid.</li>
  <li>The player that originally had the debuff gets an elemental resistance down debuff, so they <em>cannot</em> participate in two stacks of the same element in a row.</li>
</ul>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Tank swap]</b> Why don't we do a Provoke swap instead of having the two tanks cross each other (especially with Nisi)?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Two reasons:<ol><li>If a tank happens to die in Limit Cut and gets raised at the start of BJCC, their first instinct is to Provoke whichever boss they're supposed to hold. Now that Provoke has been used, you cannot then swap the bosses by Provoking the other right after Chakrams go off.</li><li>Cruise Chaser stops to cast Photon. If you swap bosses using Provoke, the tank that Provokes Brute Justice can only attack Cruise Chaser, and either has to hold damage, potentially steal hate back, or resort to stance dancing tricks that is more trouble than it is worth.</li></ol></p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hidden Mines]</b> Why doesn't D3 bait the west Hidden Mine instead of H1?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The objective is to have both Enumeration targets visible and in close proximity to one another.</p><p>Suppose D3 and H2 baited the Hidden Mines instead and D2 and D3 were targeted for Enumeration.</p><p>D2 only sees the Enumeration on D2, but now has to look at D3 to determine whether they need to switch positions with D1, with two giant robots in the center blocking the view.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hidden Mines]</b> Why don't we bait the Hidden Mines towards the outer edge of the arena? Doesn't that put the healers further away from Brute Justice so a ranged DPS doesn't bait a Hidden Mine by mistake?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The idea is to keep both bosses in the center. In particular, if the West mine is baited towards the edge, the MT has to pull Cruise Chaser closer to the edge in order to take the Hidden Mine, and doesn't leave much space for the DPS to fit in for the Plasma Shield.</p><p>Of course, you could have the MT and ST switch sides again to recenter the bosses, but that violates a different principle which is to try and keep the tanks and healers to their half of the arena as much as possible.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Plasma Shield]</b> Why are all four DPS on the Plasma Shield? Isn't that overkill?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Yes, it's overkill.</p><p>You really only need three DPS to destroy the Plasma Shield in time, but this is a single point of failure and having all four DPS on the shield is insurance against someone targeting the wrong thing by accident, or one of the DPS angled too far from the shield's front so they don't do any damage.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Crashing Thunder]</b> Why did this deal more damage than usual?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Water and Thunder work differently.</p><p>While Crashing Wave works like any other stack damage (damage is lowered as more people are hit by Crashing Wave), Thunder is the opposite; damage <em>increases</em> as more people are hit by Crashing Thunder.</p><p>This is why we want the Thunder stacks to contain exactly two players.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Compressed Water]</b> What is "Severe Contamination"?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is the pulsing raid-wide damage that you get if the waterspout left behind from Compressed Water is not frozen or destroyed by Flarethrower.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Hidden Mines]</b> What went wrong with the Hidden Mine baits? Why was a mine baited on the DPS instead of a healer?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The Hidden Mines are baited by the two furthest players from Brute Justice, which should be the healers.</p><p>If a DPS ended up baiting the Hidden Mine, it is likely because:<ul><li>A DPS was outside the green sector marked in Step 7 above <em>or</em></li><li>The ST did not position Brute Justice in the center of the arena.</li></ul></p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Plasma Shield]</b> How did the MT get one-shot?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Cruise Chaser gains a damage-up buff if the Plasma Shield is not destroyed in time, and its auto-attack will one-shot the MT.</p><p>Even if the MT survives this, the follow-up Whirlwind (before third Water) will wipe the party.</p></td></tr>
