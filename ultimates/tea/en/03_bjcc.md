# Brute Justice + Cruise Chaser

My preferred method of doing this phase is using [my Tollgate strat](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/10898230/blog/4941271/).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>At a basic level, the tanks will keep both bosses stacked in the center, with some healer movement.<br><br>The DPS make up much of the movement in this phase.</td>

## Movement

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>2.</b> Chakrams will spawn directly opposite one another at any of the eight intercardinal directions, effectively splitting the party into two.<br><br>All players move towards the edge of the arena to dodge Chakrams and bait Hawk Blasters.</td>
	<td><img src="../images/bjcc/bjcc_02.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>3.</b> When the Chakrams go off (Cruise Chaser casts Optical Sight at the same time), all players move back to the center. Both tanks swap sides.<br><br><ul><li><b>MT</b>: Wait for the <b>ST</b> to give you space before crossing over.</li><li><b>ST</b>: Enter the inner circle first, but yield to allow the <b>MT</b> to pass first before crossing over. Keep Brute Justice in the center of the arena.</li></ul></td>
