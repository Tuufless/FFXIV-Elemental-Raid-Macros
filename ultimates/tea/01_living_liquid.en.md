# Living Liquid

This is a modified version of the original Separations Living Liquid strat.

Notable changes are:
- The MT Provokes the Liquid Hand and invulns the first set of Fluid Swings and the Protean Wave from the "north" puddle.
- The first set of Protean Waves are baited by the MT and both healers, instead of both healers and D3.
- The DPS positions for the final set of Protean Waves are different.

<summary><b>[Click to Expand] Jagd Dolls breakdown</b></summary>
<p>The Jagd Dolls are adds that have the following mechanics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Jagd Dolls tether to the first player that performs any action on
  them (including auto-attacks), and lock onto that player.</li>
  <li>They periodically pulse with <em>Exhaust</em>, a point-blank AoE that
  applies a stacking <em>Luminous Aetheroplasm</em> on any player hit.
  <ul>
    <li>If any player is hit with two AoEs, they explode and wipe the raid.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The Jagd Dolls <b>cannot</b> be destroyed by damage- they will explode
  and wipe the raid if they reach 0% HP.
  <ul>
    <li>To destroy them, they need to be dragged near either Living Liquid
    <em>or</em> the Liquid Hand. Doing so will tether them to the boss and 
    destroy them, dealing raid-wide damage to the party <em>(Reducible
    Complexity)</em> based on its current HP.</li>
    <li>The Jagd Doll must be <b>under 25% HP</b>, or the explosion will deal 
    lethal damage.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
