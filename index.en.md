# FFXIV Elemental Raid Macros

This repository is a collection of macros (and my notes) often encountered in
the Elemental Data Center (DC).

Elemental is a Japanese FFXIV data center; however, it is home to servers with
high populations from other countries such as Tonberry or Kujata. That being
said, it is still ultimately a Japanese DC, so it generally follows
**Japanese** strategies. Keep that in mind that when watching (English)
videos/reading guides- there may be differences.
