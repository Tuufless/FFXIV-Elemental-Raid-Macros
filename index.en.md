# FFXIV Elemental Raid Macros

This repository is a collection of macros (and my notes) often encountered in
the Elemental Data Center (DC).

Because Elemental is ultimately a Japanese DC, these macros are for
**Japanese** PF strategies. Keep that in mind that when watching (English)
videos/reading guides- the strategies used may have some differences from the
ones here.

Of course, there will probably be small differences between the macros here and
the ones you may encounter in PF- use the ones here as a base to work with.

## Current content (Patch 7.0)

The current item level cap is **iLvl 710**.

**Extreme Trials:**
- **Valigarmanda EX** - [???]({{site.baseurl}}/7.0_dawntrail/extreme_trials/valigarmanda) *(Under construction)*
- **EX2** - [???]({{site.baseurl}}/7.0_dawntrail/extreme_trials/ex2) *(Under construction)*
