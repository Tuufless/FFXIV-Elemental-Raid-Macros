# Tuufless's FFXIV Notes

This repository is a collection of my notes for Ultimate strategies encountered in
the Elemental and Mana Data Centers (DC).

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;">
<p><b>Notice:</b> PF strats for EX trials and Savage raids have been moved to <a href="https://xivjpraids.com/">XIV JP Raids</a></p>
</div>

Documentation has been split into three categories:

- **Ultimates (Elemental):** Ultimate strategies encountered in Elemental DC.
- **Ultiamtes (Mana):** Ultimate strategies encountered in Mana DC.
- **Static:** These are the strats I would personally do (N.B: not necessarily
what PF does!)
