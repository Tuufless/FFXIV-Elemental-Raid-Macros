# About Elemental

Elemental is a Japanese FFXIV data center; however, it is home to servers with high populations from South East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand such as Tonberry or Kujata.

Because Elemental is ultimately a Japanese DC, the macros here are for **Japanese** PF strategies. Once in a while, the English community splinters and adds their own modifications.

## On macros

Remember, the ultimate goal of PF macros is to get eight people who have never played together a clear (quickly). As a result, PF favours safer, simpler strategies, even if it means disconnecting from the boss.

**If you want uptime, make a static.**

**Tanks:**
- Who MTs (main-tanks) and who STs (sub-tanks) generally follows this order:
    
    **MT** : WAR > DRK > GNB > PLD : **ST**

- You will often see English players call the ST the OT instead (off-tank).
- A note on tank swaps: Sometimes, the "MT" position refers to the original maintank, and sometimes "whoever happens to be tanking the boss at the time". As a general rule, if where the boss faces is relevant, then "MT" will refer to whoever is currently tanking the boss.

**Healers:**
- **H1** is the "pure healer" (WHM, AST).
- **H2** is the "barrier healer" (SCH, SGE).

**DPS:**
The standard composition consists of one melee, one physical ranged, one caster, and one flex DPS (typically a second melee/caster).

- **D1** is the melee spot (SAM, DRG, MNK, RPR, NIN)
- **D2** is the flexible DPS slot, and is typically a second melee or caster.
- **D3** is a physical ranged (BRD, MCH, DNC)
- **D4** is a caster (BLM, RDM, SMN)

## PF and progression

Generally, PF recruitment will generally follow the following progression:

- First time/初見 : Sometimes, you'll see 未予習 which means "without prep" or basically going blind, or 予習済 which is "have prepared" (have watched guides/videos)
- Practice○○/○○練習 : You will often see a mechanic in place of ○○, although 前半 is also common ("first half"). The focus is on learning the mechanic.
- Stabilize○○/○○安定: An extension of the above, except you are expected to have reached the mechanic before and the aim is to resolve the mechanic consistently.
- Aim to clear (A2C)/クリ目 : It is expected that you have made it to enrage at this point, and know all the mechanics. A couple words to look out for are:
    - 未 (not yet);　e.g: "未消化" = "not yet done weeklies"
    - 済 (already);　e.g: "クリア済" = "already cleared"
    - 手伝いさん (helpers)
- Weekly clear/消化 : You'll often see additional stipulations, like the party disbanding after three wipes, or after 30 minutes. These aren't practice parties. At least, they're not supposed to be. -_-
    - 3滅解散 - "disband after three wipes" is quite common with these parties.

## Loot rules

- フリロ : "Free-lot". Basically roll Need/Greed on whatever you want.
- 取り抜け : Take and drop. Everyone takes turns rolling on loot one at a time. Anyone who wins an item then drops from the instance (so everyone only gets 1 item at most).

Oftentimes, this is "take and drop from the left" (左から取り抜け), but it's also common to explicitly list out an order for 4th floor raids, like "Weapon > Weapon coffer > Body coffer > Others" (武器＞武器箱＞胴箱＞他)
