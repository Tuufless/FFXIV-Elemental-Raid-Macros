# The Minstrel's Ballad: Zodiark's Fall

No macro needed for this fight! *(just dodge everything)*

{% include youtube.html id="fg-NG2EQY-o" %}

## Markers

The `A` marker is placed so that it is the safe spot for *Adikia* + front row
AoE.

All other markers are not really needed, but can be useful for calling out safe
spots during the starstorm.
