# Anabaseios: The Eleventh Circle (Savage)

<div style="background-color: #200 ; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid;"><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b></div>

[Game8](https://game8.jp/ff14/532825) is using an updated version of Hamkatsu's strat, with ZizieZip's updated Light and Darkness strat.

### Things to check on Party Finder

- **Japanese** parties will:
  - Begin Shadowed Messengers with the boss facing true West. This results in two movements while dodging all the AoEs, but doesn't rely on the MT looking for the Light clone.
- **English** groups will:
  - Begin Shadowed Messengers with the boss facing the Light clone (or directly opposite), resulting in one less movement from the dodge.
