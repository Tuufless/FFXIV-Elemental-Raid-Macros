# Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage) - Part 2

PF uses [Inumaru's strat](https://youtu.be/1sfnBHXf2nA) (essentially identical to the Idyllshire strat, except for Act 3), with the following modifications:

- **Japanese** parties will do Inumaru's strat for Act3.
- **English** parties will do Xeno's strat for Act 3.
- Curtain Call timings are flipped from Inumaru's video:
  - Tanks/Healers cut their tethers at 6 seconds remaining.
  - DPS cut theirs at 11 seconds remaining.

## English

English parties will do Xeno's strat for Act 3.

## Markers

- `1234` are for towers
- `ABCD` are for resolving fire stacks in Act 2 (they won't line up with the thorns).

The markers also indicate the tether order for Act 4. Of note, 1234 overlap the white triangles on the floor.

## Act 2

Elemental uses the [Idyllshire Act 2 strat](https://youtu.be/1sfnBHXf2nA?t=278).

## Act 3

Note that English and Japanese groups will do different Act 3 strats.

- English groups will use Xeno's Act 3.
  - Tanks/Melee and Healers/Ranged alternate taking towers + Earthshakers.
- Japanese groups will use [Inumaru's Act 3](https://youtu.be/1sfnBHXf2nA?t=627).
  - Tanks/Melee take all Earthshakers. Healers/Ranged take all towers.
