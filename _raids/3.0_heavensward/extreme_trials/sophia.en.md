# Containment Bay P1T6 (Extreme)

An up-to-date reference would be Nukemaru's guide:

{% include youtube.html id="WsiSU759ff8" %}
*(English subtitled)*

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the Sin and Punishment spread positions.
- Check which tank takes which add.

*(These two points are different from older macros.)*

## Japanese

## English

## Markers

The `1234` markers mark the boundary for the "weak" knockback.

The `A` marker is used as a gathering point to bait falloff AoEs during second Quasar.

## Equilibrium Tilts

- Always move to the side with more tethers.
    - If the number of tethers on both sides are equal, move opposite the blue Meteor.
- If the total number of meteors/tethers is **even**, go all the way to the edge.
- If the total number of meteors/tethers is **odd**, stop around 1/4 of the way to the edge.
