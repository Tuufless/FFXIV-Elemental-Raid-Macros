# Alexander - The Eyes of the Creator (Savage)

This is [Cien Choco's macro](https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/1622544/blog/3194463/)
for Pekoelog's strat.

## Markers

At the time, only the `ABC` markers were available.

Now that more markers are available, I would place the markers as below. The
`A` marker is hidden behind the boss.

"South-left" would be the `1` marker, while "South-right" would be the `2`
marker.

- `ABD` are used for *Defamation* during *Temporal Stasis*.
- `12` are used for *Shared Sentence* and *Aggravated Assault* during
  *Temporal Stasis*.
