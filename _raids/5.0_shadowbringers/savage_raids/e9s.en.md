# Eden's Promise: Umbra (Savage)

The standard PF strategy uses [Akito's strat (あきと式)](https://youtu.be/FMJ2W5_MLW8)
as a base, but replaces the Empty Plane positions with Yamipika (やみぴか)
positions, although you'll often see "天空近接内" instead (melees in for *Empty
Plane*). Yamipika essentially ensures tanks and melee DPS have full uptime on
the boss throughout the *Empty Plane* phase.

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Tower positions may be flipped horizontally.
- It's also worth checking the *Empty Plane* positions just to be sure.
