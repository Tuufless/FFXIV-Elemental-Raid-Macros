# Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage) - Part 1

The standard PF strat takes [Idyll strat (イディル式)](https://kanatan.info/archives/25637304.html)
positions for Titan, but use [Akito's strat (あきと式)](https://youtu.be/hdLm1Q1BEWg)
for Giants (巨人) and Lion. (Akito brings the boss down to the south edge and has
the statue stacks north and south of the boss.)

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check Shiva spread positions- some macros have the healers on the NW and SE
  diagonals.
- Decide which tank is going to Reprisal *Obliteration*, and which tank will
  Reprisal *Diamond Dust* and *Earthern Fury*.
- Sort out tank Invulns for the three *Formless Judgments*. If there is a PLD,
  they should Hallowed Ground the 2nd , and the other tank should Invuln the
  1st and 3rd.

### Approximate milestones

- **54%** HP at the end of Titan phase (when the floor changes back).
- **23%** HP at the end of Lions (when the Lions disappear).

## Markers

There are two sets of markers used in PF, that are used for the Lions phase. 

**English** parties will put markers centered on the circle patterns on the
ground.

Small lions are pointed to the center of the markers, while the big lion
players dodge the fire cones in the center of the N/S markers (see image).

**Japanese** parties will put the markers aligned to the grid tiles on the
ground.

Small lions are pointed towards specific corners of the square markers, while
the big lion players dodge the fire cones by standing on the outer side of the
N/S markers (see image).

## Primals/Titan phase

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/5.0_shadowbringers/e12s_1/titan.jpg)

## Giants/巨人

The main way PF handles the giants is Akito's method or more commonly referred
to as N/S giants (巨人南北):

**Akito/1A**: MT brings boss south, party stacks north and south. MT group
stacks south, OT group stacks north (since the boss will be facing south).

## Akito TT Lion strat/ライオンAkitoTT式

Explanation (Japanese): [video](https://youtu.be/hdLm1Q1BEWg?t=657)

**Baiting small lions**: Where players stand to bait the small lions will
depend on which markers you use (see marker images above).

**Baiting big lions**: The second and third big lion baits should not be all
the way at the edge of the arena. The center of the lion is just under two
tiles away from the edge of the arena.

If you go all the way to the edge of the arena to bait the second or third big
lion, you are actually going further from the big lion, and the big lion will
target the person standing at `A` or `C` instead.
