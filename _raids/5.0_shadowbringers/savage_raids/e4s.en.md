# Eden's Gate: Sepulture (Savage)

There were two strategies used in the final phase (Orogenesis); Amaya, and Idyll (also known as "1A"). By the end of the tier, Amaya was the more common strategy.

### Approximate milestones

- **69%** at the transition to Titan Maximum
- **29%** at the start of the Orogenesis phase

## Fixed tiles/マス固定

This is an evolution of Amaya's strategy, and largely became the PF standard. It is characterized in the final phase (Orogenesis) by having the party rotate along with the exploding tile in the center.

## Idyll strat/イディル式

The other strategy used for Orogenesis was the Idyll strat (イディル式). This strat is characterized by bringing Titan north in line with the second row of tiles. Yellow melee are resolved on the top two rows, while Orange stack is resolved on the third row from the top.
