# Eden's Promise: Eternity (Savage) - Part 2

[Thoughts Per Second (TPS) strat](https://youtu.be/eBdHx53XteI)

Note: There are some details that are added in the macro, in particular, a DPS
priority order for Basic Relativity.

### Things to check on Party Finder

- **Shockwave Pulsars**: The MT usually Reprisals all the Relativities, while
  the OT usually reprisals Shockwave Pulsars.
- **Somber Dance**: The way EN and JP parties bait Somber Dance differs- EN
  parties will tend to bait next to the boss, while JP will bait on the other
  side of the arena. MT usually baits first.
- **Advanced Relativity**: The macro has D3 and D4 adjust in the event D1+D3 or
  D2+D4 have the same (non-Fire) debuffs. Some macros have D2 and D3 adjust
  instead.
  - Having D3 and D4 adjust means that each side is guaranteed to have one
    melee DPS, one ranged DPS so there's no confusion over Dark Fire spots.
  - Having D2 and D3 adjust keeps the standard based on past fights (e.g: E8S),
    but means that if a swap happens, there will be two melee on one side, and
    two ranged on the other, so the Dark Fire priorities get a little more
    complex.
- **Terminal Relativity**: Check your party's mitigation plan. 

### Approximate milestones

- **30%** HP at Advanced Relativity (when the boss becomes untargetable)
