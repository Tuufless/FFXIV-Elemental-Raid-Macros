# Eden's Promise: Litany (Savage)

[Akito's strat (あきと式)](https://youtu.be/mLFIYKvt3QY)

### Things to check on Party Finder

Since tanks swap during this fight, check with your other tank whether MT for
*Umbral Orbs* means whoever is currently tanking the boss, or the original MT.

## Japanese

## Markers

The markers are just for orientation. The intercardinal markers also are
indicators for the range of the AoE when the boss stands up.

## Final Voidgates

PF uses Akito's strat: [video](https://youtu.be/mLFIYKvt3QY&t=743)

This is not mentioned in the macro, and you are expected to know this coming

(Yes, this is a melee downtime strategy.)
