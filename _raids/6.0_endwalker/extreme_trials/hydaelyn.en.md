# The Minstrel's Ballad: Hydaelyn's Call

PF uses [Hamkatsu's strat](https://youtu.be/xrN2viqpTqc) *(yes, this is the
downtime Chakrams strat)*

## English

## Japanese

## Markers

- `AC` are for orientation. `A` is important because the boss will teleport a
  little north of the center during the fight.
- `12` are for water stacks - have the MT bring the boss center and face `A`
  right after the final Lightwaves to avoid confusion during the party
  stack→light party stack sequence.

`BD34` are often omitted, but they demarcate the safe spots behind the crystals
during Lightwaves.
