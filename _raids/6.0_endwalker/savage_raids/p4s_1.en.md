# Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle (Savage) - Part 1

PF uses [Inumaru's strat](https://youtu.be/LtrXblj9mJo) as a base, and:

- Swap in [YPP's strat](#ypp) for passing/resolving tethers and debuffs.
- Orb strats differ depending on the party.
  - **Japanese** parties will use Inumaru's strat, with [cardinal Braindead orbs](https://youtu.be/wq3lMm5Osu0?t=437).
  - **English** parties will use Inumaru's strat, typically with [Gumi's orbs](https://clips.twitch.tv/HedonisticLitigiousEyeballKippa-DwseFBSlll7XJjC1).

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check green orb spread positions *(There are **multiple** orb strats)*

## English

I personally recommend "Braindead" orbs, although English parties often prefer
Gumi orbs (below, in the hideaway) for legacy reasons.

## Japanese

This is the [Game8.jp macro](https://game8.jp/ff14/421350) often used by
**Japanese** parties.

## YPP

"YPP" refers to how PF resolves passing tethers/debuffs for *Director's
Belone* + *Inversive Chlamys*.

- Tanks/Healers take the north side.
- DPS take the south side.

1. First, pass debuffs.
  - If you are **passing** debuffs **stack** on your side.
  - If you are **taking** debuffs, **spread** on your side.
    - Take debuffs in the order `Tank > Healer > D1 > D2 > D3 > D4`.

2. Then, pass tethers.
  - If you are **passing** tethers, **stack** on your side.

Please also refer to the following guides:

- [Nukemaru](https://youtu.be/wq3lMm5Osu0?t=36) *(Japanese)*
- [Hamkatsu](https://youtu.be/-PlvK8M6h-w) *(Japanese)*
