# Anabaseios: The Eleventh Circle (Savage)

[Game8.jp](https://game8.jp/ff14/532825) is using an updated version of Hamkatsu's strat, with ZizieZip's updated Light and Darkness strat.

{% include youtube.html id="-EM-XR6qocU" %}

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the Shadowed Messengers strat:
  - **Japanese** parties will begin Shadowed Messengers with the boss facing true West. This results in two movements while dodging all the AoEs, but doesn't rely on the MT looking for the Light clone.
  - **English** groups will have the MT face the boss towards the Light clone (or directly opposite), resulting in one less movement from the dodge.
- Check who adjusts for (Dark) Jury Overruling:
  - **Japanese** parties will generally stick to the macro and have the DPS rotate clockwise to their respective T/H partners.
  - **English** parties *may* opt to have the T/H rotate anti-clockwise to join their DPS partners instead.

## ZizieZip's Dark and Light

During Dark and Light, the boss will tether the party together with two solid tethers (one light, one dark), and two split tethers (light on one side, and dark on the other).

The boss will then go through the basic mechanics of the fight, which need to be resolved together with the tethers.

The party will always rotate **clockwise** to resolve the upcoming mechanics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Damage Down]</b> How strong is the damage down debuff in this fight?</summary>

  <tr><td><p>The Damage Down debuff in this phase lowers a player's damage by <b>39%</b>.</p></td></tr>

</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Letter of the Law]</b> Why is the split N/E vs S/W, and not N/W vs S/E like before?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>This is because the logic is "from your base positions, rotate clockwise as needed".</p><p>For most other mechanics, the base positions are E/W, which means the MT group takes W or N, while the ST group takes E or S.</p><p>With Letter of the Law, the "natural" position there (supposedly) is the usual "tanks North, party South". By then applying the same logic above, you then get "tanks N or E, party S or W".</p></td></tr>
