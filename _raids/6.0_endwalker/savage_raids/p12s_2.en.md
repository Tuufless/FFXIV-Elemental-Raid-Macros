# Anabaseios: The Twelfth Circle (Savage) - Part 2

[Game8.jp](https://game8.jp/ff14/535668) has listed out a strat, but oddly did not
published a macro.

Nukemaru has published a video outlining the PF strat:

{% include youtube.html id="5c3-Rinh6lA" %}
*(English subtitled)*

### Things to check on Party Finder

- Check the Caloric Theory 1 strat.
  - **Japanese** parties will go with [Mochibe's strat](#mochibes-caloric-theory-1)
  - **English** parties will go with [Papan's original strat](#papans-original-caloric-theory-1).
- Check whether the party will line up for Pangenesis (パンゲ整列).
  - Parties that **will not** line up for Pangenesis will mention something
    like 非整列 or 整列なし.

## Japanese (Nukemaru + Mochibe's Caloric 1)

Japanese parties will do [Mochibe's strat](#mochibes-caloric-theory-1) for
Caloric Theory 1.

## English (Nukemaru + Papan's Caloric 1)

This is the preferred strat by EN, and follows [Papan's Original Toolbox](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=845983862306861&preview=1).

Take note that Papan's strat has **updated versions going around in other data
centers**, so take note if you are going to reference other guides.

### Markers (Papan)

The following markers are for Papan's Caloric Theory 1 strat.

- The `BD` markers are 9 yalms away from the corresponding east/west markers,
  which indicate the distance a player can travel before gaining a Close
  Caloric stack.

## Classical Concepts

The first part of both *Classical Concepts* will be determining where you 
stand.

A bunch of shapes will appear on the arena. When the mechanic resolves, each
blue icosahedron will tether to an adjacent red pyramid and an adjacent yellow
cube.

If two shapes tether together, the raid wipes. The objective is to have all
eight party members block the shapes from tethering together by standing in
between the shapes.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Each column will have one blue icosahedron.</p>
      <p>Identify your column's blue icosahedron based on your Playstation
      marker:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>〇: 1st column</li>
        <li>×: 2nd column</li>
        <li>▽: 3rd column</li>
        <li>□: 4th column</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, stand between your column's blue icosahedron and an adjacent
      shape based on your α or β debuff:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>α: Stand between the blue icosahedron and the <b>red pyramid</b>.</li>
        <li>β: Stand between the blue icosahedron and the <b>yellow cube</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your blue icosahedron has two adjacent shapes of the same type, 
      stand between the one that <b>does not have another blue icosahedron next
      to it.</b></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p12s_2/classical_concepts_01a.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Classical Concepts #2 adds a *Panta Rhei* just before the mechanics resolve,
which rotates all the shapes around 180 degrees. Players will first determine
where they stand before the rotation happens, before moving to their positions
post-rotation.

There is a site built for Classical Concepts that you can use for practice:

[https://idea-elemental.pages.dev/](https://idea-elemental.pages.dev/)

### Palladian Ray

Palladian Rays need to be baited at the end of each Classical Concepts.
However, because the mechanics resolve in a different order each time, the way
the Rays are baited will also change.

The most common way to bait the rays is:

- Baiting the first Rays in a 'K'-formation.
- Baiting the second Rays in an 'X'-formation.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p><b>Palladian Ray #1</b></p>
      <p>Players will dodge the shapes' AoEs first, <em>then</em> bait the
      Palladian Rays in this formation (that looks like the letter 'K').</p>
    </td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p12s_2/classical_concepts_01.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Palladian Ray #2</b></p>
      <p>Players will bait the Palladian Rays <em>between the shapes</em> in
      this formation (which will looks like the letter 'X') first, <em>then</em>
      dodge the shapes' AoEs (which also avoids the lingering cone AoEs).</p>
      <p>Note that because of Panta Rhei (which rotated all the shapes), the
      〇×▽□ order is flipped (although α still takes the north, and β takes the
      south).</p>

## Caloric Theory 1

There are two strategies used for Caloric Theory 1.

### Mochibe's Caloric Theory 1

This is the strategy favoured by Japanese parties.

versions of Papan's Caloric Theory 1 strat. The one used here is **not** the
same version used in NA.

## Pangenesis

The Pangenesis strat done here is the "2+1" variant. The numbers refer to the
number of stacks of the two players that take the **first** towers (in this
case, the players with two stacks, and one stack).

One variation between EN and JP is whether players will line up prior to
Pangenesis' cast, the idea being that by having the relevant debuffed players
move forwards or backwards, it would be easier to identify your partner.

- **English** parties prefer lining up, and have the players with 1 stack move
  forward, and no stacks move backwards. You can then identify your partner,
  and then the player on the west side of each pair takes the west tower, etc.
- **Japanese** parties will often *not* line up (you'll see 非整列 in PF
  comments), instead choosing to identify your partner via the party list.

## Caloric Theory 2

The strat used passes the Fire **anti-clockwise** around the arena, **skipping**
the player in the center (you'll often see 非経由 written in PFs).

These are the starting positions for all players:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p12s_2/caloric_2.jpg)

- The player with the **red** mark will swap positions with the MT.
- Each player (except the one in the center) will move exactly twice:
  1. Follow the red arrow anti-clockwise around the arena when the first AoE
     telegraph appears.
  1. Follow the next white arrow when the second AoE telegraph appears.

      <p>Close Caloric accumulates the <b>total</b> distance a player has
      moved with the debuff active.</p><p>Players gain a stack of Close Caloric
      when they first move, and then gain additional stacks from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting hit by the Fire stacks <em>and</em></li>
        <li>Every 9 yalms of movement (accumulated)</li>

  <b>[Caloric Theory 1 (Papan)]</b> Why is the priority order so strange? Why
  is H2 and D3 missing from the priority?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Papan's strat does quite a lot of things that do not follow
      historical convention for some reason.</p><p>The idea behind Papan's
      priority is that starting from the two end points (West for tanks and
      healers, and North for DPS), ranged have priority before melee, with the
      MT group going first, over the ST group.</p>
      <p>Put another way, it is effectively the same as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>CCW from West:</b> H1 > MT > ST</li>
        <li><b>CW from North:</b> D4 > D1 > D2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As for why H2 and D3 are missing from the priority, recall that the
      priority applies to the players in the <em>middle</em> that need to fill in
      waymarked positions.</p>
      <p>Since H2 and D3 start on a marker, and will only ever swap with H1 and
      D4 (who are also on markers), H2 and D3 will <em>never</em> be in the
      middle group, so there is no need for them to be in the priority list.</p>
      <p>H1 and D4, on the other hand, <em>do</em> need to be in the priority
      order, because they may potentially swap with a melee and putting them in
      the middle to fill in empty spots later.</p>

<summary>
  <b>[Caloric Theory 2]</b> Why are the starting positions like this?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>This is an unfortunate case of PF converging on a suboptimal
      solution:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the MT has to swap with D3, they are now out of melee range
        <b>in the middle of a 2-minute burst window</b>.</li>
        <li><em>Ekpyrosis</em> follows up immediately after Caloric 2, and the
        healers end up on the wrong side of the arena to where they need to be.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unfortunately, it's the one that's standard, so we're stuck with it
      for the time being.</p>
