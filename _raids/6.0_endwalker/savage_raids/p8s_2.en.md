# Abyssos: The Eighth Circle (Savage) - Part 2

PF uses Nukemaru's strat, with [Hydi/Bijyon's strat for Limitless Desolation](#limitless-desolation).
The combination is often nicknamed "**Nukehai**" (ぬけはい).

*(English subtitled)*

### Approximate milestones

- **40%** HP when the boss finishes casting Ego Death.

## Japanese

The following is [Game8.jp's macro](https://game8.jp/ff14/480771) for the
Nukehai strat.

## Markers:

- `1` and `2` are for the two Sigil players during Natural Alignment's Ice/Fire.
- `ABC` is for αβγ in High Concept
- `D` demarcates the center line for the two stacks in High Concept.

## Nukemaru's Natural Alignment

Here's a breakdown for the Fire/Ice portion in Nukemaru's Natural Alignment.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>These are the base positions for all players during Natural Alignment.</p>
      <p>Two players of the same role (T/H vs DPS) will be selected as the
      <b>Sigils</b> (the players with the purple mark), forcing the remaining
      six players into a 2-4 or a 4-2 split.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p8s_2/natural_alignment.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Fire** is baited by the three <b>furthest</b> players from the Sigil.

- The side with 4 players take up their base positions as above.
- The side with 2 players have to figure out the priority between themselves to
  see who baits Fire:
```
Inside: MT>ST>H1>H2: Outside (baits Fire)
Inside: D1>D2>D3>D4: Outside (baits Fire)
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Example 1:</b> MT and ST are selected as the Sigils.</p>
      <p>The remaining pairs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>H1 > H2</li>
        <li>D1 > D2</li>
        <li>D3 > D4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each pair, the player with the lower priority baits Fire (H2, D2, D4).</p>
      <p><em>Notice H1 and H2 are baiting Fire in the front of the row.</em></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p8s_2/natural_alignment_ex1_fire.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Example 2:</b> D1 and D4 are selected as the Sigils.</p>
      <p>The remaining pairs are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>MT > ST</li>
        <li>H1 > H2</li>
        <li>D2 > D3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In each pair, the player with the lower priority baits Fire (ST, H2, D3).</p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p8s_2/natural_alignment_ex2_fire.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Ice** is baited by the two **closest** players to the Sigil.

- Because the party is split 2-4 or 4-2, one of the players in the group of 4
  will have to move to the other group to make it an even 3-3 split. This will
  **either** be the MT (if T/H have four players), or D1 (if DPS have four
  players).
- The melee pair from the side that has four players (MT+ST, or D1+D2) baits
  Ice.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><b>Example 1:</b> MT and ST are selected as the Sigils.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The DPS side has four players, so D1 moves to the other side.</li>
        <li>D1 and D2 bait Ice.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>

## Nukemaru's High Concept #1

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>Note that the colour combinations are fixed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Green = α + β</li>

This is Nukemaru's strat for *High Concept* #1. Note that αβγ are placed at
**cardinal** positions instead of intercardinals, allowing players to naturally
determine their North-South priorities when resolving various parts of *High
Concept*.

## Limitless Desolation:

Hydi Ai and [Bijyon](https://youtu.be/GA3IWJde15g) proposes the following
strategy for *Limitless Desolation*.

It takes advantage of the fact that the first and third set of towers always
spawn in the top two rows, while the second and fourth set of towers always
spawn in the middle two rows.

Nukemaru also made a guide explaining the strat:

<table>
  <tr><td><p>The ultimate goal in High Concept 2 is to produce the Phoenix concept, which is done by merging two Ifrits with the two (green) birds, which are formed by combining α and β.</p><p>If the first set of towers <em>were green</em>, then players would just form two birds and immediately fuse them with the two Ifrits to make Phoenix at the first set of fusions.</p><p>Thus, the first set of towers cannot be green, and are therefore either purple or blue.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[High Concept 2]</b> Why should you create Ifrit first, before dodging the boss's E/W cleave?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>The problem is that if a healer needs to combine to conceptualize Ifrit, they need to top up the party before the second set of AoEs.</p><p>Ifrit cannot be merged in the center, as that spot is being used to merge the two tower players.</p><p>By delaying the merge to after the cleave, you prevent the healer from going to the center to top up the party to prepare for the second set of AoEs- by the time Ifrit merges and the healer can go mid, the party would have likely spread out and be out of range of healing.</p></td></tr>
</table>
</details>
<details markdown=block>
<summary><b>[Dominion]</b> Why is the tower order in Dominion D4321 instead of D1234?</summary>
<table>
  <tr><td><p>Earlier macros had D1234- the problem is that RDM is the only DPS that cannot heal/shield themselves off the GCD, and would often end up dying to the follow-up raid-wide damage. Casters also have the lowest max HP of all the DPS.</p><p>Putting the casters next to the healers in the priority order increases the likelihood that they are in range of receiving healing.</p><p>Nukemaru's video guide also puts melees towards the outside and casters towards the center for the same reason, leading to the tanks > healers > D4321 order.</p></td></tr>
