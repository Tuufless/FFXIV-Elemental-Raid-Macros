## Superchain Theory 1

The debuffs applied during *Superchain Theory* 1 split the party into
tanks/healers and DPS:

- One role is responsible for placing and resolving the aspected towers.
- The other role will spread for the Heavensflame AoEs.

Because of this, the movement after the third set of shapes is fixed:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Tanks + Healers Heavensflame, DPS towers</th>
    <th>DPS Heavensflame, Tanks + Healers towers</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p12s_1/superchain_theory_01a.jpg"></td>
    <td><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/6.0_endwalker/p12s_1/superchain_theory_01b.jpg"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Limit Cut

Limit Cut can be broken into two parts- the first four dashes, and the last 
four dashes.

Within each block of four dashes, the center add will do a small 270-degree 
cleave in the middle twice, and fire two beams at the two closest players 
twice, **all in a random order**.

<summary>
<b>[Palladion (Limit Cut)]</b> Why does 2 and 4 resolve their stack along the
edge, instead of at the vertex?
</summary>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
      <p>Athena's dash deals damage based on how far she had to dash to get to
      the next player (players take extra damage if they are within a certain
      distance to Athena).</p>
      <p>Putting 2 and 4 North results in this dash to 5 (and 7) being close
      enough to the previous player that 5 and 7 may now get killed as a result.</p>
